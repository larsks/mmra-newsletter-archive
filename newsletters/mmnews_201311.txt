MMRA QRM Policy
MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.  Measures are being taken to make audio recordings of repeater activity.

News Flash — New Release:

"Andy's Ham Radio Linux", version 14.

This software collection is a remix of Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS.   It contains a lot more software than version 13.   It can be run as a live medium, which means that nothing needs to be written to the hard drive to test drive this software. It can also be installed on a USB thumb drive or standard hard drive.

Version 14 has both 32-bit and 64-bit versions which can be downloaded freely from this website, where a summary of the available software, and some screenshots, can also be found:

Next Business Meeting: 
Wednesday December 18, 7PM  
Stratus, Maynard
----------

October Business Meeting ~ Bob Evans — N1BE ~ Clerk

The MMRA held a business meeting October 16 at the office of Stratus  Technologies in Maynard.  The meeting began at 7 PM with K1KWP, K1IW, W1DYJ, N1BDA, W1BRI, N1NVK, W1MPN, N1DDK, N1BE, WA1NVC and KG1H present.

Kevin, K1KWP presented a report of the state of the treasury.  This reviewed our account balances, historic and expected expenditures, historic and expected income, and a categorization of expenses for this year.  Kevin also provided historic and expected number of members and historic electricity usage and electricity costs for the MRW site.  More details will appear elsewhere in this newsletter.

Bob, K1IW, presented an update of the status of a few of the repeaters.  These are all at the MRW site.  On 147.27 the tone was fixed.  224.88 is off the air.  A new Quantar 900 MHz repeater was purchased; this should provide payback due to reduced electricity costs in about two years.  KB1ISZ donated a VPN capable router/gateway; this will enable hosting of IRLP and Echo Link directly at MRW without needing an Internet connection at another site.

Bob then discussed the various computers in service for the MMRA.  We are running six computers at various repeater sites and purchase access to a commercial web server for www.mmra.org.  Also two APC power controllers are used to allow a remote reset of the computers at BOS and PRU sites.

Considering the increased functions at MRW, two expenditures were approved to improve reliability of that site.  Purchase of an APC AP9211 power controller to allow reset of various devices remotely by power cycling on demand was approved, (not to exceed $105).  And purchase of a secondary (whole-house) surge protector for MRW was approved for an expenditure not exceed $150.

Bob also reported on progress of MRW site work by the City of Marlborough. As already expected, the MMRA shelter will eventually need to move.  We also heard that utilities will be re-routed underground.  We expect to be able to move antennas back onto the tank before those other site changes; Bob expects to know when antennas can move before the next meeting.


New Business:

An MMRA member requests that the MMRA pay $40 per month for his internet access at a Southboro site in exchange for repeater sites he facilitated at Menden DPW and Southboro EMC office.  The board considered this proposal and did not approve the expenditure.

Change of trustee for 146.82 from K5TEC to K1BOS.  John Mullaney, K1BOS, was approved by the board as the new trustee for this repeater.  [Note: K5TEC remains the trustee of the receiver at the Clay Center.  ...ed]

ARRL Convention Update.  As previously reported, the ARRL will hold a national convention during July 2014 in Hartford.  As a result, the Boxboro convention will not occur in 2014.  A Boxboro convention for 2015 has already been approved.

2014 Flea Market Update.  K1IW again discussed the possibility of a local ham event due to there being no Boxboro convention in 2014.  Our consensus was there is interest in having such an event on the typical Boxboro weekend.  A location very near Boston was suggested to allow easy access by many hams in our region.

Dave, KG1H got email from N1OWA who recently was badly injured. John, N1OWA is looking for help with some antenna and feedline work.  One of the board members agreed to contact John and get details of what is needed so we can organize a work party.

The MRE shelter and the surrounding area needs a cleanup.  K1IW will organize a work party.

KG1H is organizing communication for the Ashland half-marathon on Oct 27. Dave suggested using hams; this innovation was not previously under consideration by the event organizers.

The meeting adjourned at 9 PM.

Treasurer’s Update ~ Kevin Paetzold  — K1KWP

The MMRA membership year goes from September 1 until August 31 each year.  The MMRA fiscal year goes from June 1 until May 31.  The current MMRA fiscal year (which started on June 1, 2013) is called the 2013-2014 year.  The previous fiscal year (which started on June 1, 2012 and ended on May 31,2013) was called the 2012-2013 year.


2012-2013:

2012-2013 was a “Boxborough” year.  That means that it was a year that the biannual Boxborough convention occurred.  During a “Boxborough” year the club generally receives many 2 year renewals and as a result takes in extra dues and memberships than in non-“Boxborough” years.

The club finances at the end of the 2012-2013 year were an actual surplus of $854.62.   However $1950 of the money taken in was actually dues for future years (2013-2014 and beyond).  Total income in 2012-2013 was 8008.55:  $6175 in dues;  $477.86 in donations; $1315.69 in miscellaneous (which includes 121 raffle tickets).

Total spending was $7313.04:  $4412.01 on making improvements to the system and $248.43 on fixing something that was broken;  $764.11 was spent on electricity for MRW (4680 KWH);  $205 in shipping and PO BOX costs;  $372.41 in meeting expenses (among other things we sponsored a regional/open invite digital repeater informational meeting); $409.05 was spent at Boxboro (mostly the raffle prizes).  DSL and VOIP charges for MRW were $335.  The Website cost us $150.  There were $250 for the club's insurance and $150 for “rent” at MRE.


2013-2014:

More than 88% of members have already renewed (or prepaid) their memberships for this year.  If you have not yet renewed I expect you have received email reminders.

The club has already spent $1627.57 on improvements to the system this current fiscal year.

For many years WUMB was paying for the electricity at Quincy.  We thought this was OK because they were on our tower.  However WUMB is no longer located at Quincy and the MMRA was required to take over the power costs for the site.  Early indications are that this will cost the club $322 per year of recurring costs that we were previously not spending.  Regular users of Quincy repeaters who are not members are encouraged to join.  Total electric bills for the club will exceed $1000 this year.

The club (at a membership vote) previously authorized $8000 to be spent in order to return the antennas at MRW back to the top of the water tower.  In addition it is likely we will be required to move the shelter at the site.  I do not expect we will need/spend all of that $8000 but if we did I project that the club would run in the red by $8617 this year.  That sounds like a lot or money but keep in mind we have known about and been planning for this project for more than 10 years.  We have received donations for this project for over 5 years.  Even after this expense we will have more money in the club accounts than we had in 2008 and more than twice what we had in 2004 (when I changed roles to become the treasurer and K1IW became the president).


2014-2015:

2014-2015 would have been a “Boxborough” year.  As we know the Boxborough convention will not be held in deference to the ARRL Centennial in Hartford.  We have plans to represent the MMRA at the convention (any volunteers?) but it is likely we will not generate the membership renewals that we would have normally received.  Lets hope that this does not cause a significant drop in the dues we will receive in the summer of 2014.

If you have any questions about the club finances do not hesitate to contact me.  All of the above (and more) is presented/discussed at the business meetings which generally occur every 2 months on the months that do not have membership meetings.  All members are invited to the business meetings.  Location are publicized on the web site but they are usually in Maynard, MA.  I recommend that members be punctual for the business meetings as they are often held at somewhat secure corporate office sites where we often have to let people into a locked building (and the meeting room is not at the front door).   Also we generally meet at a local restaurant for dinner before the meeting so if you are interested in coming to the meeting and meeting for dinner please let us know.   We have been seeing some new faces at the business meetings and it would be good to see more.

73,

Kevin (K1KWP)

President’s Corner
Bob DeMattia — K1IW 
Marlboro West

Probably the biggest topic of conversation for the MMRA over the past year has been the status of our main repeater site on Sligo Hill in Marlborough.  Because of work on the water tower there, all of our repeaters have been running on temporary antennas 20 - 30 feet off the ground, a loss of over 100 feet in elevation.   This has drastically affected the coverage of 53.81, 147.27, 224.88, 449.925, 927.7, and our APRS digipeater on 144.39.  This situation was supposed last three months, but here we are a year and a half later, still waiting.

As a quick update to this situation, things are definitely moving at the site.  Recently, one of the cell companies completed their installation on the tower.  I've personally had two meetings with the city and will be having a third in the next week.  I'm now mildly optimistic that we will have coverage restored at this site in the near future.

I want to thank everyone for their patience.  I, as well as the rest of the board, are just as frustrated as anyone. 

73 — Bob
