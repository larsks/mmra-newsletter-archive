January Membership Meeting ~ Wednesday, 18 January, 7 PM

12V Power for Emergency Power Use 
Greg Troxel, N1DAM  
Location: Northborough Public Library
Talkin: 147.27

Greg Troxel, N1DAM, will give a presentation about 12V lead-acid batteries and (off-grid) solar power for emergency use for Amateur Radio.  The talk will cover testing batteries (and why you should not trust batteries you have not tested), types of solar charge controllers, metering, power distribution and connectors, and system sizing.  Greg will describe his experience with powering his station entirely off-grid since February 2013.  The talk is aimed at those who have hooked a 12V power supply up to a 12V radio, but have not really contemplated extended operation without utility power.

Greg joined the MIT UHF Repeater Association in the first week or so of his freshman year at MIT and remained involved through gradual school.  He obtained his first Amateur license (and current call) early in 1984, sitting for the exam at the Customhouse building in Boston with an actual FCC examiner.  He bought a pair of 33 Ah batteries at the MIT flea around 1990, and has had backup power in various states of functionality ever since.  Besides occasional operation on HF, local repeaters, and 2m simplex, he has recently operated Field Day both solo (1B) and with PART (3A).  He still needs to get around to building a Pixie kit bought at Boxborough in 2012.  Professionally, Greg is a researcher in networking at the organization formerly known as Bolt, Beranek and Newman.  Besides Amateur Radio, Greg has volunteered for the town of Stow about light pollution issues and perambulation of town bounds, and is active in NetBSD and OpenStreetMap.

Directions to the 
Northborough Free Library

Directions from I-495:

>From I-495, take Exit 24B which is Rt. 20 West toward Northborough.
Follow Rt. 20 West about 3.5 miles, into the center of Northborough.
Opposite the Gulf Station on the right, turn left into Patty Lane.
The Northborough Free Library parking lot will be on the left.

LIBRARY PARKING:  
Patty Lane is right across from the Gulf station.  Follow Patty Lane to the library parking lot.   
The red brick building next to the library has a tempting driveway, being right next to the library, but it is private property.  Please respect the owners' property, and use the library lot.  Additional parking is available on the corner of Hudson and Pierce, or at Town Hall.  

Traffic exiting Patty Lane should stay to far right, even for left turns, to avoid traffic turning in. The lane closest to the pizza shop is for INCOMING traffic ONLY from Rt. 20 eastbound.

MMRA QRM Policy
MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.  Measures are being taken to make audio recordings of repeater activity.

November Membership Meeting
Linux in the Hamshack
Andy Stewart, KB1OIQ 

Andy presented his "Andy's Ham Radio Linux." This is free software to both make our hobby more fun and operating easier.  

Andy has been running Linux user groups since 1997, and taught Linux classes for several years in Chelmsford.  He created his Linux package in 2011 as a way to give back to both the ham and Linux communities.  

Andy is President of the Police Amateur Radio Team (PART) in Westford, holds an amateur extra license, and is also an ARRL Assistant Section Manager for EMA.  He has a master's degree in electrical engineering from WPI, and by day works as a digital logic verification engineer.

Note that these are only a few of his slides.  The slides with screen shots will not show up at this size.  However you can request the full slide deck from Andy at kb1oiq@arrl.net.

[Following are 14 of his 52 slides.]

Massachusetts State Police Communications History
Tom Turner, KB1OQA

Law Enforcement Radio Communications for the Massachusetts State Police began in 1929.  An Amplitude Modulation or AM frequency of 1.666 Kilohertz operating in the Medium-Wave Band provided one-way Dispatching for State Police Patrolmen, now known as Troopers.  The first radio-equipped motorcycle was placed in service in 1936. A small number of two-way radio units were placed on this frequency in the early 1940’s. Shortwave Morse Code Stations were located at SP Framingham and SP Northampton.  These facilities, staffed with trained operators, were used for communication(s) between States.

The original AM Medium-Wave equipment was replaced in 1941 by radios operating on Frequency  Modulation, or FM, on 35.78 Megahertz and 35.90 MHz, based on a Proposal received from MIT.  A Study prepared by the MITRE Corporation of Bedford, MA in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s recommended that a change be made to a Statewide 460 MHz  system in an effort to eliminate inadequacies found in the Low-Band Frequency Spectrum.  However, it was decided to remain on the low band, utilizing frequencies in the 42 MHz portion of that spectrum.  They were: 42.44, 42.34, 42.40, 42.50, 42,54, 42.46, 44,74, and 44.90 Mhz. In the mid-1980’s, 150 MHz Very High Frequency (VHF) portable radios and vehicular repeaters were purchased which operated on 159.42 MHz.  The merger of the Capitol Police, MDC Police, Registry of Motor Vehicles Police, and State Police took place on July 1, 1992. Each agency had a separate radio system on various frequencies.  The MDC’s 800 Mhz operations began in 1980.  

After Consolidation, it was determined the best course of action for the new Department of State Police was to build out the MDC’s existing 800 MHz system, as it offered increased coverage and technological capabilities.  Troop-B in Western Massachusetts has been upgraded from older analog to newer digital technology.  Broadcasts to and from Troopers can now be clearly received with fewer “Dead Spots” that result in loss of radio signals, posing a safety hazard.

Tom, KB1OQA, is a volunteer at the Massachusetts State Police Museum and Learning Center and a member of its Board of Directors.  He is also one of MMRA’s Net Controls.  This information is excerpted from MSP’s 150th anniversary book.
