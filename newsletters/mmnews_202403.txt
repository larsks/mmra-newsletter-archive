The 100 Pound DXpedition: The first 20 years — Scott Andersen, NE1RD

This is a Hybrid meeting: New England SciTech + ZOOM

Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

Twenty years ago, Scott learned of DXpeditioning and couldn’t wait to try it himself. 
Several teams documented their exploits using lightweight gear, small, manageable 
antennas, and modest team sizes. Though new to the hobby, Scott studied a dozen 
DXpedition DVDs until he thought he could manage something similar (even with his 
limited experience). Thus was born “The 100 Pound DXpedition.” Why 100 pounds? 
Because airlines let you bring two fifty pound bags with you on a flight! This talk reviews some of Scott’s travels, experiences, and mistakes. He hopes you learn enough to want to try this yourself. 

B. Scott Andersen, NE1RD, holds an Extra Class license. Though he’s been licensed since 2002, has a really nice set of Begali paddles, and has even confirmed 226 entities on CW, he can’t send morse by hand to save his life. He still smiles every time he sees a sunspot.

Marlboro Flea VE Session ~ Ron Rothman, WO1E

The February MMRA Volunteer Examiner licensing session was held at the Algonquin Flea Market on February 17th in Marlborough, MA.  Those VE’s in attendance included Steve Babbitt KC1LPZ, Joe Reynolds KA1QDQ, Sue Benua WB2OSY, Henry Piel KQ1V, Alan Lewis K1ALL, Dave Hornbaker N1DCH, Scott Anderson NE1RD and Ron Rothman WO1E.

The number of candidates being tested was down from our usual number of 15.  While only 7 candidates were tested, we had 2 new Technicians, 2 upgrades to General and 1 
upgrade to Extra.  Unfortunately, 3 candidates did not earn a new license or an upgrade.

Our next VE testing session will be held on March 23rd at 9:00 AM at the Marlborough Fire Station on 215 Maple Street in Marlborough.

Once again, The MMRA VE team will be on hand at the HamXposition on August 24th at the 10:00 AM session.  In addition, I have been appointed to coordinate the exam sessions at the HamXposition.  There will be three testing sessions Saturday at 10:00 AM, 1:00PM and Sunday at 10:00 AM.  If you are a VE and want to help, please contact me on my cell (774) 258-0058 or email rrothman22@gmail.com.  If you are interested in becoming a VE, please contact me as well.  It’s not as hard as you may think to get certified as a Volunteer 
Examiner.

Treasurer’s Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year.  On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank people below who donated since my list in the January 
newsletter: W1RLO, W1NPE, and W1WG.  Also almost all of the equipment donated by N1CTY that I mentioned in previous newsletters was sold at the Marlboro Algonquin Flea in February.

The MMRA had two tables at the Marlboro Algonquin Flea which cost the club $30.  The two tables were attended to by KC1US, K1IW, and me.  We walked away with $285, most of which was from the N1CTY equipment.  The total mass of the stuff we have been carting to the flea market has significantly reduced :-).

As of this writing there are 234 paid memberships for the 2023-2024 year.  At this point six 
people would still need to join or renew to reach parity with the 2022-2023 year (which ended on Aug 31, 2023).   Sixty-five members have not yet renewed and fully expired on Jan 1, 2024.

The funds balance was $22193.93 on June 1,2023.  At this writing on Feb 29, 2024 the balance is $19903.75 .  Based on all the information I have I predict the balance on June 1,2024 is likely to be $19477.70.  That is a deficit of -$2716.24.  This assumes we get the six new memberships/renewals to reach parity with last year.  This also assumes the membership and/or board do not approve any additional significant spending not already known.

Repeater clocks and Daylight Savings Time ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW

Twice a year in most of the US and a number of other countries, we are blessed or perhaps cursed with changing our clocks by an hour.  Each of MMRA's sixteen SCOM 7330 controllers, located across thirteen locations, has its own clock.    Fortunately, SCOM designed the controllers to handle DST automatically.  Thus keeping them on the correct time zone is trivial.

The more challenging aspect of these clocks is keeping them accurate.  Left unchecked, they can drift several minutes in a year.  This would mean that the net linking commands across the 
network may occur all over the place instead of at the precise time they are supposed to run.  Although setting the clocks automatically would be a slow manual process, SCOM left us a tool to automate this also.   There is a command that will tell the controller to round off its clock to the nearest minute.  If the controller clock lost a few seconds in a day, it would move the clock forward.  If it gained a few, it will move the clock back.  The trick is who should execute the round-off command and when?

This is where the main HUB comes in.  The main HUB (449.925) has an IRLP node connected to it, which runs off a Raspberry Pi.   The Pi runs NTP, network time protocol. A system running NTP is able to keep its clock within a few milliseconds of NIST's atomic clock.   Each evening at 3:30 AM, the IRLP node on HUB1 sends a command to the 7330 telling it to round off it's clock.  The 7330 in turn sends a DTMF command to all other controllers on the network to do the same.  If you are listening to 449.925 at 3:30AM, you will actually hear this being done.  As long as a clock does not drift more than 30 seconds in a day, it should work.  Since the DTMF commands take a second or two to propagate, the clocks aren't exactly the same time, but they are within a few seconds of each other and will stay that way.

MMRA to host US Coast Guard Auxiliary Net

Joseph Fratto, N1RLO

Starting Sunday, 10 March @ 11am

The USCG Auxiliary is a uniformed component of Team Coast Guard. The Auxiliary was formed on June 23 1939 by an act of congress. It was called the Coast Guard Reserve Volunteer. In 1941 the USCG Military Reserve was formed in response to WWll. The old reserve was named the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Every so often Congress would pass legislation concerning the duties of the Auxiliary. In 1996 Congress passed legislation that allowed an Auxiliarist to perform and be assigned any and all duties of the USCG except direct military and law enforcement powers.

During 1996 we had over 55,000 members and today we are down to about 30,000 members. We have had some notable auxiliarists such as Lloyd Bridges of the old TV show "Sea Hunt", Al Roaker the TV weatherman and our Ham friend Gordon West.  Auxiliarist West is very active in California with Comms.

About 10 years ago the Boston Area Auxiliary formed the "Boston Auxiliarist ARC" Callsign W1CGX.  It died down during Covid and we are trying to bring it back. The upcoming net at 11:00 AM starting on Sunday 10 MAR 2024 will be called the "Auxiliary Net". It will be open to all Hams who want to take part. We especially want to hear from auxiliary operators such as USCG, ARES and SKYWARN to name a few. RACES and CAP are also invited.

The MMRA has been very gracious by opening up and connecting a number of repeaters for the Net.  When the USCG first formed the Reserve and later Auxiliary, being a Ham radio operator was required for membership. There was a lot of monitoring of HF for distress signals. Hams were good at CW and were already self trained. It also did patrol activities. The USCG Auxiliary is credited with saving lives at sea every year. They teach a lot of boating safety classes and man the USCG stations to relieve the regular Coast Guard.

17 January 2024 Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:34 PM 

Repeater Status Report: 1/14/24 - Bob DeMattia – K1IW
     Quincy: 146.670 – Link Radio Transmitter has failed. The replacement is in K1IW’s garage. No date set for repair. We still have to work with City of Quincy officials.  Editors update: Bob has replaced this and Quincy is again linked. 
     Marlborough/Hopkinton 70 cm – 448.225/449.575 – Marlborough DSTAR and Hopkinton will
swap frequencies in early March. This is being done to reduce interference in Hopkinton
between the main transmitter and link receiver.
     Belmont: (formally Belmont) Time constraints between Bob, K1IW and Ed, KC1CLA, has delayed progress on relocating a new site.
     All other repeaters are at nominal operation.

Presentation 
Larry Banks, W1DYJ, “A 10m FM Antenna to Fit into my Attic”

Larry’s extensive and impressive background was published in the January, 2024 MMRA Newsletter. Briefly stated here he was licensed in 1962, holds 3 degrees in EE from MIT, an accomplished DX chaser, editor of the MMRA Newsletter, coordinator for our weekly TIOS Net Control Operators and active 
Member of the MMRA helping all of us in many more ways than can be expressed here. By going on QRZ under Larry’s call sign, a link to Larry’s personal webpage will provide numerous presentations and 
published articles he has produced . That will be well worth your time.

Currently Larry has a 6m vertical antenna in his attic, so the challenge was to put a 10m vertical in his 
attic without interfering with the 6m antenna and to fit the 10m vertical into his 5-foot-high attic that 
required 8+ feet in height. The fascinating part was figuring out how he was going to get a round peg into a square hole (as a figure of speech) as he captivated all of us watching his presentation. Initially to solve the mystery, Larry started with antenna modeling.  In theory the numbers showed a low SWR on both the 10m and 6m verticals, but when Larry started building the 10m antenna, the SWR and the impedance were way out of bounds. As he said, “modeling” usually does not match reality. One problem was trying to use two 50-ohm coax cables in parallel to achieve the a 25 ohm impedance transformer, but that turned out not to work as the impedance of the antenna was not the modeled 15 ohms. Revamping what he had built still did not solve the interference problem between the 6m and 10m verticals. Like a 
mystery novel, the suspense continued.

I am not sure I can adequately describe what Larry did to get both his 6m and newly installed 10m 
antenna up and working so I am going to make the following suggestion:

For those of you who forgot – like me - the theoretical questions we had to know to pass our Extra or General Class License Exams, I am going to strongly recommend viewing the slides Larry has made on his website and in the MMRA Newsletter to understand how he solved this mystery. Hint: He did solve it.

Elections --We encourage anyone who is a member in good standing to submit their intention to serve to the Board of Directors so we can add your name to this ballot list. This list of candidates is open to change.

Public Service – Bruce, KC1US:
     The Boston Marathon: The MMRA will have six Repeaters available to support this event. Echolink will not be available. The weekend prior to the actual Monday event repeaters will be changed to marathon linking configuration and return to default mode Monday evening. 
     Coast Guard Auxiliary: The connection between the government and amateur radio has been accelerating into a strong working relationship. There is a daily maritime mobile net on 20 meters (14.300 MHz) that impacts coastal activities from the South Shore, Boston Harbor to the Maine coastline. ARES, MARS and other radio operators like the ham radio community are involved. Another communication channel mentioned was NEG2 on Echolink. KC1US will be writing an article explaining the basics of all this for the MMRA Newsletter.

Boston 900 MHz Repeater – Roger, WA1NVC
     Rather than buy a new 900 machine, the two machines we have will be put together as one working unit. Buying new will have an estimated cost including shipping around $900. Instead, Roger suggest using the parts we have to build one usable machine that will be tested and burned in over a period of time before being deployed. Still needed will be a power supply and cables.
     Waltham also has a similar system so to coordinate with them we will set up a key base logging system instead of giving out any system passwords. That way we still maintain security and know who has used our system.

Repeater Status Report: - Bob DeMattia – K1IW
     Quincy 2m .67 Repeater Currently Quincy 2m repeater has been disconnected from Hub1 because the link radio transmitter has failed. The replacement is in Bob’s garage, and he will have this fixed by March 15th. Editors update: Bob has replaced this and Quincy is again linked. 
     The City of Quincy has voted for $250K for improvements to the Tower. The Parks Department is telling us renovations are imminent, but they have not even bid out the contract yet. So far, the questions we have asked have not been answered. We are working with the Mayor’s Office to coordinate this project. We prefer to keep .67 where it is currently located. At the same time, we may have to prepare for another location. This is not a high priority because .82 on the Pru has pretty much similar coverage. However, redundancy in coverage is important should .82 malfunction.
     448.225/449.575 -Marlborough DSTAR and Hopkinton will swap frequencies in early March. This is being done to reduce interference in Hopkinton between the main transmitter and link receiver. 
     (Formally) the Belmont Repeater: Time coordination for this repeater location has been scarce. Bob will coordinate with Terry and Ed, KC1CLA. Initial approach made to the Belmont Emergency Management Group.
     Billerica 147.12: The antenna clamp has come loose so the antenna is tilted about 15 degrees. While inspecting the situation, the antenna must be fixed by lowering it down. KB1KTR, Kevin F. was approached by building management who told him they will be contacting K1USN about removal of our equipment.
     All other Repeaters: Functioning normally.

Club Activities: - Stephen, KC1LPZ
     Support to New or less Active Hams – The purpose of this agenda item is to raise our awareness that we must find creative ways to keep these new Hams involved by being more helpful.
          The Free Memberships to new Technicians is to help get a jump start in Ham Radio and in the MMRA Organization. Suggestions from contacting new Hams, helping them program their new Radios by live or recorded video demonstrations and other forms of Elmering.
          Concentrating on the less active Members: Often many are reluctant to ask for help. We must find ways – activities - to help them be more energized.
          Encouraging more timely membership renewals by asking or determining what support they need or want from the MMRA. Some clubs have done surveys. Others have provided social events, often at regular intervals. A lot of ideas were expressed and discussed.
     Establishing Relationships and Programs in our Schools, like STEM. The question here is how many of us have relationships with our local schools and other organizations that we can use to build upon.
         Hands on Projects, like circuits, soldering, wire antennas, small group activities to help hams get on the air. The more success one has getting on the air will likely keep them involved.
          POTA Buddies – This was not specifically discussed at last night's meeting, but the concept was expressed in our written agenda as a catalyst on generating additional activities.

As I wrote in the January, 2024 MMRA Newsletter, we must add to our Amateur Radio/TV/Digital Community to continue growing despite the downward trendline in our numbers. We enjoy what we do so sharing our passion one person at a time is the next step.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (448.225) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
