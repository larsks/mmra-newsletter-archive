President’s Corner ~ David Wolfe, KG1H

As the president of the MMRA, I participated in the ARRL New England Division Cabinet Meeting on Saturday, July 9th.  Even though not all MMRA members are members of the ARRL, most of the subjects discussed apply to all hams.  Attendees initiated most of subjects that were discussed.

The Air Force is involved in a major upgrade to the PAVE Phased Array Warn (PAVE PAWS) in both Cape Cod and California requiring additional testing next year.  They reported that the noise floor is increasing across the band.  The information that came down to ARRL is that the impacts to the ham utilization of the 440 MHz band may require ‘adjustments’ from what it is now, and may require an ‘extension’ of the impact radius. As you might recall, some 440 MHz repeaters close to PAVE PAWS were shut down and others further out (impact radius) required that their output power be greatly reduced.  The ARRL is monitoring the situation.

The general consensus of all the attendees is that the number of hams that participate in public service events across New England has been greatly reduced from what it has been several years ago.  Some thought that the increasing age of those participating has been the main reason, and that the new/younger hams have not picked up the interest.  Some associations rely on preprogrammed cell phones, a few on DMR.  That lead to a discussion of how we need to attract the young to become hams and participate in these events.  Any ideas are welcome.

The full House Energy and Commerce Committee at a markup session on July 13 unanimously adopted a substitute bill in the form of an amendment to  the Amateur Radio Parity Act (H.R. 1301).  The next step for the bill as amended is for consideration by the full House.  There is no current timetable for that action.  It will ensure that every ham in the US, regardless of the community they live in, will have the opportunity to practice their avocation from their own homes without breaking any rules or fear of reprisal.

No FCC action on ham VLF as yet for 472-479 KHz and 135-137 kHz.  Expecting something soon.  Coordinating with the power companies is complex.  Clearly, our national power system is vulnerable.  

The effectivity of the FCC Official Observer (OO) program has been reduced by less FCC enforcement.  The OO program serves as the first line of "eyes and ears" for the FCC. It is the backbone of the Amateur Auxiliary. OOs are certified in the Auxiliary by passing a mandatory written examination.

Attention!
Quincy 146.67 is currently running on temporary equipment while the permanent rig is repaired.  It is at 40% of normal power and NOT linkable.  Quincy 224.4 is off-the-air.  This will revert to normal operation in about six weeks or so.

Hopkinton Heliax Cables donated to MMRA

Thanks to Rick Zach, K1RJZ, on the afternoon of July 21, the MMRA removed twelve donated 160+ foot sections of Heliax cable (and some antennas) as they were removed by contractors from a 200’ tower in Hopkinton.  Here are photos of the operation, thanks to Rick and Dave, KG1H.  (Following are 9 photos.)

June Business Meeting
Bob Evans, Clerk, N1BE

Minutes of the June MMRA Business meeting by N1BE, MMRA Clerk

The MMRA board met for a business meeting at the office of Stratus in Maynard, MA at 7:00 PM on June 15.  In attendance were K1KWP, N1DDK, W1DYJ, N1BE, W1BRI, KG1H, W1MPN, N1NVK, WA1NVC  and K1IW.

New MMRA President Dave, KG1H, opened the meeting with a discussion of overall running and management of the MMRA.  We reviewed roles of the club leaders.  Dave emphasized the need for active support.  Particularly since it takes many skills from many different people to make the MMRA productive and interesting.

Dave looked at various technical specialties.  Although we collect this info on the membership application, the categories need to be revised.  Experience shows that members do show up and volunteer when we need some labor, like the recent repeater move to North Reading.

With so many repeaters, the maintenance effort is too much for the few people we have that know how to work on a repeater.  We brainstormed ways to train interested members in how to do preliminary diagnosis and simple repairs.

Dave suggest putting together a list of who to call for each kind of failure.  Also documenting the details of each repeater / site.

Next we reviewed locations and speakers for general membership meetings.  We will have an MMRA presentation at Boxboro on Sept 11th.  This will be the MMRA meeting for that month.

We next discussed the MMRA room at Boxboro.  N1NVK will be making arrangements for talk-in.  Clark also agreed to purchase items for a raffle.  The board approved an expenditure of up to $350 to purchase prizes.  We also plan to offer a 6-M beam owned by the MMRA as another prize.

Discussion next turned to our primary assets, the 22 repeaters.  Given our membership numbers, there is approximately one repeater for each 10 members.  This is a lot to support.  But it also offers a lot of value to each member.

Dave next reviewed standby power for the repeaters - batteries and generators.  No action was taken except to discuss how we could power the HUB1 site in an emergency if someone brought a generator or source of 12V DC to the site.

Although KG1H had an agenda item about DMR, we did not discuss this item due to lack of time.

Next we discussed a few open issues needing action in the near term.
- W1BRI proposed a new home for 449.575.  Bryan will move the repeater if the site is available.
- When 449.575 is moved K1IW offered to pick up feedline and accessories at the same time.
- K1IW is replacing two repeater power supplies – Brookline is already done.
- We have to do more work on the antenna mounts in North Reading - deferred until autumn.
- Determine cause of failure and repair North Reading 446.775 failure - K1IW volunteered to do this, W1DYJ offered to come along to learn about the site.
- Isolate source of Quincy 146.67 intermittent noise - W1BRI has parts and plans to go to the site to replace a marginal N-connector.

Ed Curley, KC1CLA, was appointed as the new trustee of Belmont 145.43.

The board approved purchase of tickets for dinner tables at Boxboro.

The board approved an expenditure not to exceed $50 to repair an MMRA RS-50M power supply.

We adjourned at 20:49.
