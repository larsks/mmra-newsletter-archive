Interactions between Antennas in a 10/15/20m Stack
Larry Banks - W1DYJ
This is a Hybrid meeting: New England SciTech + ZOOM

Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

In 2000 Larry homebrewed a 5 element 10m Yagi and put it on a roof tower.  In 2004 he added a 20m homebrew Moxon.  Finally, in 2010 he added a homebrew 15m dipole.   Now and then he heard something he didn’t understand.  Recent modeling revealed counterintuitive antenna patterns.

Larry was licensed in 1961 as novice KN1VFX and became W1DYJ in 1966.  He was an engineer and project manager in Hewlett-Packard Medical's Cardiac lab in Waltham and Andover MA 
starting in 1969.  In 1985 he started the Cardiac R&D lab’s Printed Circuit CAD group and the 
SW Quality Testing team. He moved to HP Medical Education in 1993, responsible for technical and project management training. When Agilent split out of HP in 1999, he became Agilent 
Technology’s global program manager for their Learning Management System. "Retiring" in 2005, he then consulted for Avago (now Broadcom) on eLearning technologies through 2012.  Larry holds three degrees in EE from MIT.  He spends his time chasing DX and contesting in Woburn, traveling with his wife Maren, and attending (now also streaming) many jazz and classical 
concerts.  He is the net manager and newsletter editor for the MMRA, publications editor for HamXposition, and a member of the YCCC.

I would like to thank those that stopped by the MMRA booth during HamXposition.  It was great seeing you in person!  We had 2 new members sign up, 7 new hams applied for free memberships, and 27 renewals.   We sold a total of $362 in raffle tickets.  We had more visitors at our booth’s new location in the main hall.

This year, the MMRA VE team lead by Ron – WO1E, conducted all three VE sessions on Saturday and Sunday.
The team administered a total of 19 tests during the weekend.  See below for a complete report.

Congratulations to the raffle winners and special thanks to those who participated in the MMRA raffle.

Join us for the September 18, 2024, membership meeting at New England Sci-Tech in Natick, MA.  Larry Banks – W1DYJ will be discussing his 10/15/20m stack and the interactions between the antennas.  If you cannot make it to Natick, this is a 
hybrid meeting, and the Zoom meeting information is available on the website (www.mmra.org).  You must be logged into the website to view the information.

Join us Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM for our weekly Technical Information and Other Stuff (TIaOS) net.  There will be a lively discussion on all sorts of HAM issues, including equipment, antennas, software, repeaters, and other stuff.  The main 
purpose is to test our ability to link up the repeaters in case of an emergency, or to support some event like a marathon.   You can also join via EchoLink if your radio is a little under the weather (or in my case too lazy to walk down to the shack).  See below for more information.

You can find out more information about how and when the repeaters are linked on the website (https://www.mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html).

VE Update: HamXposition+++ ~ Ron Rothman, WO1E

Over the past year, the MMRA VE team conducted exams from August at HamXposition 23 until June 2024.  Besides HamXposition and the Algonquin Flea, exams were held at the Marlborough Fire Station and City Church in Marlborough.  July is the only month where exams are not given. During the 2023 / 2024 season, 57 exams were given. Twenty Six (26) Technicians, 11 Generals and 12 Amateur Extras either upgraded or earned a new license. Only six (6) candidates failed to earn a license. 

This year we lost one of our own.  Willie McConnell KB1MFG 
became a SK after a long illness.  Willie joined the MMRA VE team on March 18, 2006.  During that time, he participated in a total of 196 VE sessions. Willie will be remembered as always welcoming to the candidates greeting them with a smile on his face and words that would put a nervous candidate at ease.

    				Willie will be missed!

MMRA conducted all three exam sessions at this years HamXposition 2024.  Exams were held at 9:00 AM and 
1:00 PM on Saturday August 24th and 10:00 AM on Sunday August 25th. The results were as follows: 
Element 2 Technician 		7 New Hams
Element 3 General 		4 Upgrades
Element 4 Extra 		2 Upgrades
Failed to earn a license   	6			Total taking a test:  19

The number of candidates is down from the pre-Covid days at Boxboro when MMRA had over 30 candidates at the 9:00 AM session alone.  We need to do a better job of promoting testing at the convention.  I would like to thank all of the VE’s who volunteered their time in the important job of licensing new hams.

The meeting ended informally at 7: 54 PM.

Presentation by Kay Savetz  - K6KJN - “Twenty Things I’ve Learned While Curating the Digital Library of Amateur Radio & Communications.”  To provide a simple summary she mentioned the “Wayback” machine that allows the ability to search the internet since its founding. The digital library is similar. Kay’s presentation was in reverse order starting with item #20.  “Marshall H Ensor”, created nightly one hour lectures – about 60 of them -- sponsored by QST. Item # 19 is “Hap Holly’s” RAIN (Radio Amateur Information Network) Report which has 1300 episodes. Item #18 “Don’t Mess with . . . the Museum Janitor who wrote in 1944 a letter requesting visitors not to throw their cigarette butts on the floor as ashtrays were provided. Item #17 had 40 years of TAPR Conferences, which preceded packet audio. More related Ham Radio conferences were included in this subject area. The MMRA Newsletters are filed under Item #15. That section includes Ham Club Newsletters that have been digitized along with many other club documents where available. Throughout this entire presentation so many HAM Related books, magazines, audio conversations, audio programs, videos in every imaginable format is being digitized.  It seems like there is an inexhaustible supply of material. However, Kay pointed out their collection is far from complete with Item #2 giving us a listing of just a subset on what is identified as missing. The process of digitizing is ongoing as this library seeks to locate private collections. Item #1 is “Hams are generous with their knowledge” willing to share with others. Based on all the questions from us, this presentation clearly sparked a deep interest to continue to use this digital library on an ongoing basis. This digital library is addicting.

DLARC: A Personal Perspective ~ Larry Banks, W1DYJ


Kay’s presentation of the Ham Radio archive DLARC (see previous pages) immediately raised my curiosity about two topics.

Many of you know that W1DYJ is not my original call.  I was first licensed as KN1VFX (novice) in December of 1961.  W1DYJ is an “Additional Station License” I received in 1966 when I wanted a second station at my college apartment in Brookline.  FCC regulations were far more strict back then — a second station at a different location required a separate “Station License.”   (This was way before Vanity Calls.  Back then you could not purchase a call of your own choosing.  You took whatever the FCC sent you.)

I have often wondered who was the first ham to have W1DYJ. DLARC gave me my opportunity.  In the Fall 1932 edition I found a Ray Webster in Duxbury with the call W1DYJ/p.  Interesting!  Like me, I guess Ray wanted a second call — a portable.  I wonder if it was a vacation home?  Ray is no longer listed in the 1937 edition.

Ray was not in the Summer 1931 edition.  The last 1x3 listed in 1931 is W1CYE.

I found a Bob Small of North Reading in the 1946 edition, the year I was born.  He wasn’t in the 1947 edition.  Two hams had WN1DYJ novice calls: Dick Newton in Concord (1955) and Bob Bell in Norwalk CT, summer 1965 and Spring 1966.  Neither kept the call.  I wonder if that is why I got the call in 1966 — someone at the FCC may have seen that Bob/WN1DYJ had dropped his license and was holding my request in their hand and decided to just give it to me!  I consider myself lucky to have this call. 

                  So, I’m the fifth person to have this call!

When Kay mentioned that DLARC has a lot of instrumentation manuals I was also immediately curious about whether I could find a manual for an instrument I worked on during the summers of 1967 and 1968.  I was working in R&D for Singer Metrics in Bridgeport CT, near my hometown of Stratford.  Singer Metrics was a division of Singer Sewing Machine Company.  I found the manual!  My project was to develop the control circuits of a low frequency extender plug-in for a signal generator: the SG-1000.  I learned all about waveguide cut-off frequency in this project.   

DLARC has many gems!

19 June 2024 Business Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:31 PM via ZOOM

HamXposition – Larry – W1DYJ –
Approved Tri-Fold printing not to exceed $250.
MMRA Table will be in the hallway across from the exhibition hall.
Call in Station – Rig and Antenna:
	N1DCH – Antenna, Mast & Coax
	K1KWP – Radio, coax and power supply.
Linking – last year we had all Marlborough repeaters linked. We decided not to link 6 & 10 this year – They are not listed in our program ad.
Foxbox – K1KWP plans on deploying on Friday and moving the Foxbox at least once.
Table Staffing – K1KWP will coordinate
A laptop and connected TV is also needed

Repeater Status Report: - Bob DeMattia – K1IW

Mendon 146.610 Link Receiver has failed – not decoding PL tones.  Bob was able to fix this by recycling power on the link radio, but the problem returned two weeks later. A replacement radio is ready and will be swapped in the next time Bob can get to the site probably by the end of June.

(Formally) the Belmont Repeater – 145.430 – The Repeater is now on the air currently at Bob’s house. Ed KC1CLA is going to the Town of Belmont on finding a new location. With a congested schedule, this may take a bit longer to resolve
Temporarily located in Boxborough
Small Antenna
Running 6W instead of 100W
Site elevation lower in height from its prior Belmont site

Quincy 2m .67 Repeater A letter was sent to the Mayor prior to Hamvention In a follow up call on May 31st, they indicated there were issues with the site we had suggested, but they are working on it. They will get back to Bob on it. Since no further word was said from the City of Quincy, the current plan is to leave the repeater in its current location until:
	They provide another site at which point we will move the repeater OR
	They will tell us we have to go and ’67 will go to the Marlborough East site.

Billerica 147.12: No further progress on a new site. The antenna is still at a tilt. The Current plan is to leave the antenna in place until the following:
We find another site at which point we will move OR
are told to move resulting in locating the repeater in Burlington

All other Repeaters: Functioning normally.

ARRL News Bulletin: Bob suggests we do a concise weekly report on the network. W1HAI offered his assistance. N1DCH, K1KWP, W1DYJ & KC1LPZ support this idea within the framework of Part 97.

Club Activities: - Stephen, KC1LPZ 
Support to New or less Active Hams – The purpose of this agenda item is to precisely target the concerns and unasked questions that frustrate these folks from being active. Also attracting younger people to obtain a Ham Radio License.

Summary of the May 6th Regional ARRL Conference Call: 
	With various clubs struggling to address this same issue, several ideas were generated in the limited time we had on this conference call.
	Greet, greet, greet – i.e. make new folks feel welcome to join in on what we do.
	Follow up by engaging them to want to be involved.
	Create activities at regular intervales such as social gatherings, workshops, training and Elmering.to name a few of the wide range of Amateur Radio/Digital activities.
	The ARRL does provide Grant Monies to many organizations that have specific programs getting young people “on the air”. On grant money the MMRA should support all the efforts K5TEC at the NE Sci-Tech Center does rather than duplicate their proven programs.

The MMRA brings the following assets:
	On UHF and VHF we have 20+ Repeaters where anyone in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern NH can access to communicate with one another. Few Clubs have that kind of capability. Plus we have IRLP / Echolink to extend these capabilities.
	K1KWP emphasized we need to reach out when we hear a new callsign using our system. He mentioned one example where the QSO with one individual extended to just over an hour.
	On our weekly NET we must pay close attention to new folks joining us.
	Welcoming and greeting new folks on our system is our major asset and we need to utilize our extensive system at every opportunity.

The MMRA’s Drawbacks:
	Social gatherings have not worked in the past because our members are geographically distant due to our extensive communication system resulting in extremely low attendance. That is one reason we also use Zoom as an alternative to increase attendance.
	The MMRA does not do Field Day because our system does not extensively involve HF. Plus many of our members are involved in other surrounding clubs that do Field Day and are more local to these members.

Final Summary
	Continue with our 1-year free membership. It does work. Many of us at tonight's meeting joined after our free membership expired.
	Be aware when we hear a new callsign using our repeater system that we reach out to them to make them feel welcome. In that endeavor find out why they obtained their license and how we can help on an individualized basis.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (448.225) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
