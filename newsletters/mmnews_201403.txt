A Peek Into the World of Nanotechnology

Paul Anzalone, N1PA

Location: Tatnuck Bookseller, Westborough 

This talk will discuss technology of yesterday, today and where we're headed in the future. We'll look at what kind of equipment allows us to look at the atomic scale and why it's so important to be there.

Paul is the Director of Research and Development at a New Hampshire company, specifically characterizing Carbon Nanotube materials. Paul has worked in Nanotechnology for the past 28 years and finds it fascinating to see where technology will bring us in the future.

About the Minuteman Repeater Association

The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur Radio and public service.  The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters in Eastern Massachusetts.

The MMRA meets (usually) on the 3rd Wednesday of each month from September to June.  Meeting times, locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this newsletter and on weekly nets.  Meetings are open to all interested parties.  Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in September, November, January, March, and May.  The intervening meetings are also open to all members and are for general business.

The Minuteman newsletter is Emailed one week before each general interest meeting.  Members are encouraged to submit articles which can be sent to the editor at 
newsletter@mmra.org.  The deadline for articles is the last Friday of the month preceding the meeting.

Each Tuesday evening at 8PM the MMRA links most of the repeaters for an open net.  The topic is “Technical Information and Other Stuff”.   Join us!

Membership in the MMRA is open to all radio amateurs.  Annual dues are $25 per individual or $35 per family.  See our website for details.

Email to the club leadership should be sent to 
contact@mmra.org. The MMRA maintains a web site at:  http://www.mmra.org/

An email distribution list for club members named “MMRA” is at: www.yahoogroups.com/.  

You can also follow us on twitter @mmraham and like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mmraham.

MMRA QRM Policy

MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.  Measures are being taken to make audio recordings of repeater activity.

WRTC 2014 Volunteers Needed

Doug Grant ~ K1DG

The World Radiosport Team Championship (WRTC) will be held in Massachusetts July 12-13, 2014.  Like the Boston Marathon, this event draws the "best of the best" from around the world.  Fifty-nine two-operator teams will be set up with Field-Day-style stations on 16 properties around the Route 495 corridor, from Pepperell in the north to Plymouth and Taunton in the south.  The international teams will compete to see which team can make the most contacts with the most countries and take home the gold medal. This Olympic-style world championship will be widely covered in the local, regional, and national media and provide excellent publicity for amateur radio. 

The WRTC2014 organizers need volunteers to help with this once-in-a-lifetime event.  The biggest need at the moment is for people to help set up and keep an eye on the stations and provide local transportation for the teams between the headquarters hotel in Westborough and the sites.

MMRA has a long history of successful support of events like this, and WRTC2014 can use your help.  Please visit www.wrtc2014.org/volunteer to sign up and tell us how you would like to help in making this exciting event a success.

Learn more about WRTC2014 at www.wrtc2014.org.

Public Service Events
David Wolfe — KG1H

The Ashland Sporting Association in conjunction with Squanto Productions of Quincy is offering a 13.1 mile preparation race for "Boston" to be presented at Marathon Park in Ashland MA on Sunday, March 16.

See http://www.marathonparkprep.com for more information. 

The MMRA and members from other radio clubs supported the Ashland Half Marathon last year, which was the first time “hams” had supported the Ashland Sporting Association.  The race officials recently contacted me, KG1H, requesting support for this year’s event.  

Mark Richards, K1MGY, has volunteered to organize this ham activity [the first MMRA public service event this year]. Support has been outstanding.

The Marathon Park Prep, a half-marathon race and a tough, hilly warm-up test for April’s Boston Marathon, will begin and end at Marathon Park on Pleasant Street on Sunday, March 16.  After opening ceremonies, runners cross the starting line at 10:30 a.m.
