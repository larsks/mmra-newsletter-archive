Membership Meeting ~ Wednesday, January 16 ~ 7 PM
Technological Evolution in Disaster Communications
Tom Carrigan, NE1R, will discuss disaster communications from 1970 to present and the implications for Amateur Radio as an emergency communications resource.
Northborough Free Library, 34 Main Street, Northborough

Talk-in: 147.27

Directions to The Northborough Free Library from I-495:
>From I-495, take Exit 24B which is Rt. 20 West toward Northborough.
Follow Rt. 20 West about 3.5 miles, into the center of Northborough..
Opposite the Gulf Station on the right, turn left into Patty Lane.
The Northborough Free Library parking lot will be on the left.

LIBRARY PARKING 

Rt. 20 construction has made it difficult to see the library parking sign on the corner of Main St. (Rt. 20) and Patty Lane.  Patty Lane is right across from the Gulf station.  Whether you're coming from out of town, or just not sure where to park, follow Patty Lane to the library parking lot.  
 
The red brick building next to the library has a tempting driveway, being right next to the library, but it is private 
property.  The property has recently been sold, so the building won't be vacant much longer.  Please respect the owners' property, and use the library lot.  Additional parking is available on the corner of Hudson and Pierce, or at Town Hall.

The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur Radio and public service.  The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters in Eastern
Massachusetts.
The MMRA meets (usually) on the 3rd Wednesday of each month from September to June.  Meeting times, locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this newsletter and on weekly nets.  Meetings are open to all interested parties.  Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in September, November, January, March, and May.  The intervening meetings are also open to all members and are for general business.
The Minuteman newsletter is Emailed one week before each general interest meeting.  Members are encouraged to submit articles which can be sent to the editor at newsletter@mmra.org.  The deadline for articles is the last Friday of the month preceding the meeting.
Each Tuesday evening at 8PM the MMRA links most of the repeaters for an open net.  The topic is “Technical Information and Other Stuff”.   Join us!
Membership in the MMRA is open to all radio amateurs.  Annual dues are $25 per individual or $35 per family.  See our website for details.
Email to the club leadership should be sent to 
contact@mmra.org. The MMRA maintains a web site at:  http://www.mmra.org/
An email distribution list for club members named “MMRA” is at: www.yahoogroups.com/
No part of this newsletter can be copied or posted elsewhere without prior approval from the club. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

MMRA QRM Policy
MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.  Measures are being taken to make audio recordings of repeater activity.

President’s Corner ~ Selecting an HF Transceiver
Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

I realize MMRA is primarily a VHF/UHF club, but many of us are also active, or would like to be active, on the HF bands as well.  A question that comes up often is “what’s the best HF transceiver”?  As is almost always the answer – it depends!

I found thirty-four HF transceivers currently on the market.  When I compiled my list, I excluded anything that wasn’t ready to operate “out of the box”.  For example, one manufacturer in particular, FlexRadio systems, specializes in transceivers which you must control from a PC.  Kenwood also offers a transceiver like this.  There are also a few manufacturers that offer transceivers in kit form.  These may very well be excellent products, but for the purpose of comparison, I wanted to keep my list restricted to main line traditional radio forms.

The first question you need to ask is – how am I going to use this radio?  Casual use?  DX? Contesting?  Awards?   The more serious you want to get about contesting, the more you are going to need better receiver sensitivity and selectivity.  More expensive radios often include additional features to eliminate locally generated noise or to handle QRM.  The second question might be “what is my budget”?   In fact, this might be the first question.  Almost everyone I know is on a budget.  If you are the exception, then lucky you.

Estimated prices range from $520 to over $12000.  There are actually some specialty companies that go higher, but I figure $12000 is more than enough.  You will find that radios at the lower ends have simpler displays, poorer receiver performance, or may lack features such as a band scope that lets you see where the activity is on the band.  Most transceivers include coverage up through 54 MHz, but there are exceptions.  There are a handful of radios that also include the 2m and 440 bands.  These transceivers may be in the same price class as others with VHF/UHF, but may sacrifice other features or HF performance.

Are you in the market?  Use this list as a guide, but investigate further the ones that are in your price range.  Keep in mind that some radios include an AC power supply.  If they don’t, you may need to add the cost of the supply to your purchase.  Many radios include, or have available, at extra cost an automatic antenna tuner.  Unless you are really lucky, you will probably need to have one of these if you want full access to all of the bands.   To help you here, I included columns to indicate which radios have a built supply and/or tuner.

(Editors note: Reviews of most of these rigs can be found in ARRL’s archives.  Additional comparison specs can also be found on Sherwood Engineering’s site:  http://www.sherweng.com/table.html .)

A New Antenna for Lowell
Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

	At the end of December, club members were asked to approve funds to replace the Lowell Repeater antenna which has failed.  This measure passed by a vote  of 72 to 3, with 2 abstentions.  The new antenna will be a Decibel Products ANT450D6-9.  This antenna will provide a gain of approximately 9dB.  In order to do this, radiation outside the horizontal plane of the antenna is pushed into that plane.
	Think of the pattern as donut shaped.  The donut is laying on its side with the repeater in the center.  As the gain increases, the donut gets flatter.  More signal is pushed horizontally so locations above or below the horizontal plane of the antenna get less signal.  There are situations in which a higher gain antenna can actually be detrimental.  Lowell is not one of these cases.
	The vertical beamwidth of a 6dB antenna is 34 degrees, for a 9dB antenna is 15 degrees.  This makes the beamwidth a little over twice as large for the lower gain antenna.  When everything is located in the same +/- 400 feet of the  antenna, the narrower beamwidth will have no effect and the advantages of the 9dB antenna are clear.   Below is a plot showing the 225 deg radial from the Lowell repeater.  This radial is of particular interest because it  follows I-495.
	As the plot below documents, the higher gain antenna will provide superior coverage for [continued] the Lowell site.   To show some contrast, I also superimposed the same pattern on our Prudential site (right).  In this plot you can see how the Prudential site is so high up that the higher gain antenna is hurting locations that are too far outside the antenna's plane.  Fortunately, we are using a 3dB gain antenna at the Prudential site and this is why.

Donations and Membership
Kevin K1KWP, Treasurer

The MMRA receives donations from members every year.  Historically it seems that we do not publicize donations or even say thank you.  At a recent business meeting we discussed this and decided to list the donators from the last two membership years.

Donations during Membership Year 2011-2012 (last year):
AB1IV	K1BC	KB1VQE	KD1CY	KD1TE	KG1H	N1DDU
N1KFV	N1YAZ	N1YDF	NV1W	WA1JIM

Donations during Membership Year 2012-2013 (this year):
K5TEC	KB1LY	KD1TE	KT4OK	KX1M	N1DDU	N1NUS
N6QXA	W1CWJ	W1HBR	W1WRV	WA1JIM

As of 4 January, 172 members have joined or renewed for this year.   This is 11 members short of of the 183 from last year.  46 members from last year have not yet renewed.  This indicates that 35 new members have joined this year.  It was my hope to publish a list of the new members but for multiple reasons it was determined that our current database makes that query problematic.  Stay tuned for list of new members in an upcoming newsletter.

Also as a result of recent discussion at a business meeting we decided to publish the list of all members who are renewed .  If your callsign is not on one of these lists and you think that it should be please email/notify the board.

November Membership Meeting
What We Owe The Early Hams

How ham radio operators made friends, saved lives,
and helped to create commercial radio.

Donna Halper

Tatnuck Bookseller in Westborough

Our November guest speaker was Donna Halper. Donna told us many stories about what ham radio operators did over the past 100 years to help their communities and help build the commercial broadcast industry. Ms. Halper is a respected and experienced media historian, who makes regular appearances on WBZ's Jordan Rich Show. She is also heard on WBUR-FM and WGBH-FM and is frequently quoted in the Boston Globe and other newspapers. She is the author of five books, the most recent of which is "Boston Radio 1920-2010," a history of Boston radio in words and pictures.   [Editors note: I purchased this book from Donna that evening and really enjoyed it!]  You can read more about Donna at http://www.donnahalper.com/bio.html.

>From Donna’s Web Site

Boston's radio history begins with pioneering station 1XE/WGI, one of America's first radio stations, and includes the first station to receive a commercial license, WBZ; the first FM radio network, W1XOJ and W1XER; and one of the first news networks, the Yankee News Service. Nationally known bandleaders like Joe Rines and Jacques Renard were first heard on Boston radio, as was one of the first weathercasters, E. B. Rideout. The city has been home to a number of legendary announcers, such as Bob and Ray, Arnie Ginsburg, Dick Summer, Dale Dorman, and Charles Laquidara; talk show giants like Jerry Williams and David Brudnoy; and sports talkers like Eddie Andelman and Glenn Ordway. Many Boston radio personalities, such as Curt Gowdy, "Big Brother" Bob Emery, Don Kent, and Louise Morgan, found fame on television but first established themselves on Boston's airwaves. Since 1920, Boston radio has remained vibrant, proving that live and local stations are as important as ever.
