Membership Meeting ~ Wednesday, 18 January 2012 @ 7:00 PM

Introduction to D-Star

Northborough Free Library ~ 34 Main Street (Rt. 20), Northborough
Talk in — 147.27
Terry Stader KA8SCP will be visiting to provide an introduction to D-Star digital radio technology.  With the MMRA D-Star repeater now on the air, the timing couldn't be more appropriate!

Directions to The Northborough Free Library from I-495:
>From I-495, take Exit 24B which is Rt. 20 West toward Northborough.
Follow Rt. 20 West about 3.5 miles, into the center of Northborough..
Opposite the Gulf Station on the right, turn left into Patty Lane.
The Northborough Free Library parking lot will be on the left.
--------

Quincy 220 back on the air!
Thanks to Bryan, W1BRI,
and Roger, WA1NVC!  
Bryan can hit it with his rubber duck on a VX7 portable at 300mW from his Milford 2nd floor shack room.  Roger can also, with his Alinco HT from Framingham.  Power into the antenna cable was measured at 45W.

President’s Corner

Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

August isn't too far away, right?  If you're involved with the New England Convention, August is never too far away, but especially now.

In a few short weeks, tickets for the Boxboro convention will be on sale.  I bring this up because the convention is one of the best way to advertise MMRA to many hams that aren't members.   MMRA provides the talk-in for the convention and in return is given a hospitality booth to greet potential new members.  

We need ideas and volunteers to help out with the planning and execution at this event.  If you have a really neat idea that we could use at the convention, let us know.  Would you like to help staff the table for a few hours?  Let us know.

MMRA Repeater Controller Primer – Part 2 - Linking
Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

In the last installment, I discussed how the MMRA repeater systems were standardized.  This was done for two reasons: (1) to make it easier to maintain all of them and (2) to provide a consistent set of control commands for both control-ops and users.  With a large linked network, one of the biggest problems to overcome is keeping the linking commands from getting too complicated.  It would be good if people are able to remember how to link and de-link without confusion, but at the same time have lots of flexibility.

Each MMRA repeater can operate unlinked, linked to HUB1, or linked to HUB2.  There are user commands which work on all repeaters to accomplish this.  The exact DTMF codes are available to members on the members-only portion of our website.  Use of the link commands is on the honor system.  If you are not a member, or your membership is expired, please refrain from using the linking commands.

When an MMRA member changes the link state with a user command, the change is temporary.  After nine minutes of repeater inactivity, the controller will revert to the default state.  The default state may be permanently changed by the control-op version of the linking command, or by automatically scheduled event such as the MMRA TIOS net link up on Tuesday nights.

The three commands are of course “Delink”, “Link to HUB1”, and “Link to HUB2”.  For dual-repeater sites, there is only one controller and one link radio, so there are no combinations where one repeater is linked to HUB1 and the other is linked to HUB2 at the same time.  Also, one repeater cannot link to both HUBs at the same time.

The controller operates in one of eight modes.  These modes and the transitions between them are explained best in the table to the right.  If a command is not listed for a particular state, it has no effect.  Note that if there is a command that would change the linking from HUB1 to HUB2, then the repeater not being linked by the new command will always end up unlinked.

When linking, you shouldn’t have to worry much about this table.  Just enter the link you want to change and the controller will take care of the rest.  When you say “Link to HUB1”, the controller looks at which repeater you are on and assumes that repeater.  This allows you to use the same command, for example, on 147.27 or on 224.88 but that command will translate to “Link R1 to H1” or “Link R2 to H1” automatically.  When you are on a HUB, there are specific unique linking commands for each repeater.

Transition Table    (H1 = HUB1, H2 = HUB2)

State 	Repeater 1	Repeater 2	Command
		New State
#	(R1)		(R2)		Received	#
-----	----------	----------	-------------	----

Marlborough West Shelter Gets an Upgrade 
Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

You may have seen this photo, or one like it, in previous issues of The Minuteman.  This was the shelter that housed the MMRA’s main Hub repeater, 449.925, as well as 147.27, 224.88, 927.700, the receive end of 53.81, the 447.875 affiliated repeater, and the APRS node.  

The club had gotten used to the frequent rodent visitors that found many ways to access the interior.  However, after the heavy rainstorms in mid-August 2011, we were treated to a new problem when we found moisture inside the shelter.  This prompted the addition of the blue tarp.  While the tarp endured the subsequent tropical storm Irene, it didn’t provide full protection.  Moisture and electronics don’t generally mix well, so the decision was made that the shelter needed to be replaced before it went through another winter.

The club knew this day was coming for a long time.  In 2009, Bob Stone, N1KMA donated a new shelter to the club.  All we had to do and come and get it (Bob lives in Maine), so we did!

The shelter laid in waiting for nearly two years.  In that time, the inside was cleaned up and the outside was given a new coat of paint.


On October 21st, club members descended on the old shelter and removed all the equipment.  Later in the evening, the old shelter was dragged onto a flatbed truck and hauled away.

The equipment was brought to K1IW’s garage for safe storage 

The next morning, the ground was graded to provide  a flat surface.
And the new shelter was put in place by crane. 

With the shelter in place, all the equipment was repopulated.  It is now protected from weather and rodents!  

Special thanks go to Keith KB1OEI who hauled the shelter from Maine, stored it for almost two years, pulled out the old shelter and arranged for the crane to put the new shelter in place (all free of charge).  To James N1DDK for designing, organizing, and contributing greatly to the new shelter rebuild.  Also thanks to James KB1LOY for organizing the replacement effort and providing valuable expertise.  

Finally, thanks to all the other club members who helped with the paint job, the old shelter cleanout, and the new shelter build up!

MMRA December Board of Directors meeting
Bob Evans ~ N1BE ~ Clerk

At 7:00 PM on December 14th the MMRA Board met in the Maynard, MA headquarters of Stratus Technologies.  In attendance were K1KWP, K1IW, N1BDA, W1MPN, W3EVE, KC1US, W1BRI, N1DDK, N1BE and WA1NVC.

Kevin, K1KWP, presented a report with details of our treasury balance, income sources and spending.  As previously reported, the MMRA was hit with expenses, including large planned and unplanned maintenance projects that exceed the income this year.  Kevin projects $1325 of additional expenses this fiscal year.  We also reviewed MRW power usage.

Then Bob, K1IW led a discussion of repeater status:

145.160 D-Star is back on the air in Boston but unbalanced with transmitter coverage reaching into NH, but the receiver range is much more limited.  K1IW believes that the high 2-meter noise level at the site is the primary problem.  Bob suggests dropping transmit power from 100 W to both decrease some de-sense as well as to balance the transmit and receive range.  We are also considering replacing cables and adding a circulator to that system.  It was suggested to plan a longer site visit possibly including surveying the received spectrum, so as to minimize the impact on the site host.

The reworked 224.40 repeater is ready to go online in Quincy, perhaps as soon as December 28th.

Site work by the City of Marlborough continues at the MRW site.  There was a tarp with an ice load pulling on the feedline of 449.925.  Bryan tightened the connection at the lightening arrestor that may have been affected by this.  Also the 6-meter receive antenna is bent.  Due to the city's site work, we may need to replace some MMRA feedlines at the time all the site feedlines are re-routed through the soon to be installed central standpipe.

Roger, WA1NVC suggests a network test with all sites routing through HUB2.  This would indicate which sites need some enhancement.  The goal would be to have a redundant hub capability.  This may not be feasible for all sites like Lowell, with the present frequency plan when the links are also considered.

At present MRE has difficulty linking to HUB2.  And last night during the TIAOS Net, HUB2 did not seem to be linked to HUB1.  We also discussed synchronizing the clocks in the outlying repeater controllers to the time in a 7330 HUB controller. 

Bruce, KC1US reports good receive sensitivity in the Burlington VHF repeater that he has been monitoring for the last several months.

Other repeaters are operating normally and were not mentioned.

There have been a few recent changes of repeater control operator.  These are the control operators in the NESMC database.  (Each repeater also has a trustee registered.)  K1IW has become control operator for 146.79 at present.  Jim, N1DDK is the new control operator of 147.27.  And Ron, KB1UXT is the new control operator of 442.250.

We then considered plans for the Algonquin flea market on Feb 18. WA1NVC and KC1US will represent the MMRA at this event.  We have been asked to allow talk-in on 147.27.  We will query AARC whether they also want to use 449.925.

With a Boxboro convention this year, we began to consider MMRA involvement.  Much time was spent considering how to attract people to the MMRA hospitality suite.  We discussed free sodas to members, free bottle of water to those who pay dues, raffle prizes, etc.  The MMRA has an IC-730 HF radio that by consensus will be used for a raffle item.  We also considered a few other possible prizes like test equipment, a new 6-meter beam already in MMRA possession, and perhaps a new handheld VHF/UHF radio.

The MMRA web hosting provider moved their equipment to a new site today.  K1IW provided a backup site with the most popular mmra.org content for today.  At the time of the board meeting, the web host completed their relocation.  With DNS updates needing to propagate, we should be online with all normal mmra.org content tomorrow.

KC1US reported on the use of the MMRA network for public service events in the year 2011.  Details will appear elsewhere in the newsletter.  We also discussed putting similar info on the MMRA web site.

The meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM.
