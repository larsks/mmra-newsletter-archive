Wednesday, 20 May, 2020 ~ Annual Meeting & Elections ~ 7:30—9:30 pm
ARRL Antenna Book Software: TLW, YW, HFTA, EZNEC ~  Larry Banks, W1DYJ
Location: ZOOM  — Members: login to the MMRA Webpage for the link

Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra.org

This “Antenna Modeling 101” presentation will start with why Larry has always studied antennas.  It will then highlight the various software packages available in three ARRL Books.  Detailed use of four packages – TLW, YW, HFTA, and EZNEC, using some of his homebrew antennas as examples – will help you get a start at modeling your own antenna systems.

Larry was licensed in 1962 as novice KN1VFX and then Technician, K1VFX.  He received W1DYJ in 1966 while in college in Cambridge and holds an Amateur Extra Class license.  

He developed diagnostic cardiac systems as an engineer and manager for Hewlett-Packard Medical in Waltham and Andover from 1969 to 1985.  From 1985 to 1993 he was the Section Manager 
responsible for establishing the Cardiac Ultrasound R&D lab’s Computer Aided Design environment, the SW Testing and Quality group, and ongoing Technical Education.  Moving to HP Corporate Education in 1993, he became Agilent Technology’s manager for their global LMS (Learning Management System) when Agilent split out of HP in 1999.  From 2005 to 2012 he consulted for Avago Technologies (now Broadcom) when it split out of Agilent, serving as global manager for their corporate LMS and consulting on eLearning.  Larry holds three degrees in Electrical Engineering from MIT. 
 
When he is not playing with antennas, he spends his time chasing DX and contesting, both in Woburn and at his second home in Maine; with his second hobby of woodworking; and with his wife Maren attending jazz and classical concerts and traveling.   He is the Net Manager and Newsletter Editor for the MMRA, a member of the YCCC, Publications Editor for FEMARA which runs the Northeast HamXposition, and a board member of the Merrymeeting ARC in Downeast Maine.

President’s Corner ~ David Hornbaker, N1DCH 

We can stay connected in a quarantined world.   Amateur radio is in a unique position to stay connected, both locally and worldwide.  In addition to the MMRA TIaOS net every Tuesday there are several other local nets that you can participate in https://ema.arrl.org/eastern-ma-nets/.

If you are just getting started, you do not need the perfect antenna.  For VHF/UHF a mag mount antenna on a sheet pan will work well.  An old coat hanger and a coax connector can be made into a very inexpensive 2-meter vertical (http://w6par.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CoatHangerAntenna.pdf).

On HF, I have worked Europe on 20 and 40 using a homebrew 6 m ½ wave dipole and an antenna tuner, not optimum, but it works.  In the last few weeks, I have worked special event stations in Spain, Italy, Louisiana, and Texas on 20 and 40.  Again, I do not have resonant antennas, or a big amp, or sunspots, just 100 watts and a wire. Get on the air and get connected!

This month's membership meeting and annual elections will be on a Zoom teleconference.  The link for the meeting is https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83007194489?pwd=ZUNxenhWOFpEL3U0T2tsUjgrSTB4dz09.  If you have not used Zoom before, I would encourage you to try it out before the meeting.  Install the client (available for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and android) or connect via the web.  Then connect to the zoom test meeting https://zoom.us/test.  More information is available at www.mmra.org.

Stay safe and stay connected!       73 – Dave – N1DCH

New England Amateur Radio holding on-line VEC sessions

Bob Phinney, K5TEC

New England Amateur Radio Inc (NE1AR) in collaboration with New England Sci-Tech in Natick, MA, has authorization of the ARRL VEC and the FCC to administer fully online video-supervised exams. These non-profit educational organizations, founded by Bob Phinney K5TEC and Ted Reimann W1OG and managed by a board of directors, support STEM education for all ages with an emphasis on amateur radio. Bob and Ted began a series of trials on April 1 under ARRL VEC review and are now supervising a team that provides ARRL approved video-supervised test sessions almost every day of the week. They are also training other ARRL-vetted teams across the country and are working with the software developer of the exam delivery system, ExamTools.org and HamStudy.org, to help them streamline the system for video-supervised testing. At the moment only one person at a time can be tested, which limits the number of candidates and adds significant time to the VE team’s schedule. An additional time issue is how long it takes a candidate to go through the security protocol involving video-checking the candidate’s work area and room, reading the protocols, getting the electronic surveillance set correctly, etc. Sometimes the setup and follow-up for an exam takes longer than the exam itself, in order to provide complete integrity of the exam session. Currently they have a backlog of several hundred who want to be tested, so the team is giving priority to candidates who need to take the AE exam before June 30.

Treasurer’s Report, May 2020 ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

The current MMRA fiscal year ends on May 31 of this year.  That fiscal year was known as 2019-2020.  Pretty much everything in this article is about that current fiscal year.

A new year begins on June 1, 2020.  That new year will be known as 2020-2021.

MMRA income exceeded expenses in this fiscal year.    A summary of the income and expenses for the last 10 years is in chart below.  This current fiscal year is labeled as 2019.  You can also notice that due to people paying dues for future year we are already recording income for the 2020-2021 fiscal year.

CHART of INCOME and EXPENSES

The chart (below) shows the funds balance delta for the last 10 years.  This indicates we have had a surplus the last 3 years.  Keep in mind that some years we have much greater expenses due to repairs and improvements (see 2011-2012, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017).

CHART of ACTUAL BALANCE DELTAS

Income sources are detailed below.  As you can see large majority of income is from dues.

Last year (2019-2020) the MMRA had 228 paid memberships.

CHART of PAID MEMBERSHIPS

The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year.  Most of this is in direct $ contributions.  Some donations are of equipment which the club either uses or sells.  Donation summary for the last ten years is below.

CHART of DONATIONS

On behalf of the club I would like to thank people below who donated since my list in the previous newsletter..  Hopefully I did not leave anyone off (and if I did I am sorry):

N1UPY	W1NPE	K1MPS

Detailed financial information is presented at almost every business meeting.  These meetings generally occur in the months which do not have general membership meetings.  They are announced on the www.mmra.org website.  All members are invited and encouraged to attend these meetings.  Of course much more than finances are discussed at these meetings including repeater status, repeater decisions, planning, etc….

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), and Hopkinton (449.575).  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.

In attendance: 
Dave, N1DCH; Kevin, K1KWP; Jason,W1HFP; John, WA1MDD; Bob, N1BE, Bruce, KC1US; Bob, K1IW; Roger, WA1NVC; Chris, KC1MRK; Charles, KC1JUO; Bill, N1KUG; Larry, W1DYJ

Old Business
Should we purchase a Yaesu DR2X to be used as a backup repeater?
	Discussion points brought up:  Do we need a backup repeater?  Should we replace the North Reading 440 DR2X with something else and use it as a backup? Should we purchase something else as a backup? Will it ever really get used?
Moved (K1KWP): recommend to the Annual Meeting that we purchase a DR2K for $700.
APPROVED 11-1

New Business
	Given the current COVID-19 climate, what teleconference application should we use?
Tonight’s application: ZOOM Pro
	$14.99/month (credit card or PayPal)
	Ability to save recordings locally
	Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android clients
	Meetings up to 24 hours with 100 connections
	Phone Number for phone access
	Security?
Skype
	Free (unless we do Skype for Business and that would be very expensive)
	Unlimited connections
	Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android clients
	Recordings available on cloud for 30 days
Others
	This topic generated a lively discussion.  There are many pros & cons for each application discussed.
Moved: reimburse Dave (N1DCH) for two months of ZOOM pro, use it for the May membership meeting, and review afterward.
APPROVED:  unanimous

Elections
	All current board members, except Clark (N1NVK), have agreed to run for reelection.
	N1BE is interested in serving as director
Moved: with the addition of N1BE as Director, recommend the slate of officers to the full membership at the Annual Meeting.
APPROVED:  unanimous

Linking repeaters during severe weather
	Should repeaters be linked during severe weather?
	Would Rob (KD1CY) want us to link things up?
	After some discussion, including that the SKYWARN repeater configuration has been in place for 
20 years or so, the consensus was that KD1CY should be asked if we can help in the future.
	Kevin (K1KWP) agreed to approach Rob to offer MMRA assistance in whatever way made sense

HamXposition November 2020
	Postponed to November – will postpone discussion until October

MMRA Network Status
The following sites have their replacement equipment ready for install but, progress is stalled due to the COVID situation:
	Belmont: New link radio and antenna >> in K1IW’s garage
	Mendon: Controller Upgrade 	>> in K1IW’s garage
	Burlington: Replacement RX Crystal 	>> KC1US has it, waiting to get into Lahey Hospital
The following sites require an OS upgrade:
	BOS (927.0625)			>> Done by the time the meeting started
	MRX (927.7000)			>> Done by the time the meeting started
	HUB2/WES			>> In process during the meeting
	HUB1 (OS is recent, but is corrupt)	>> Finished after the meeting

There was much discussion about the future of our OS upgrades at our repeater sites. 
	MRW & BRK are Dstar and run Centos 7
	HUB2/WES is on Raspbian 9
	All other sites are Raspbian 8
	Centos 7 & Raspbian 8 are still supported
	Latest OS is Raspbian 10
		With Raspbian, you have to update one version at a time (separate steps).  Each step takes 100’s of MBs.
	We would have to have Tello service on our 5 Freedompop lines in order to do upgrade.
	Also risk breaking something when done remotely – then a site visit is necessary
After much discussion, the consensus was that replacing the micro SD cards (with new, updated images) made the most sense.  This will be easy except at the Quincy site which is difficult to access.  Issues about using any OS other than Raspbian 10 were mentioned.  

Upcoming Meetings
	May – W1DYJ Antenna Modeling – ZOOM Teleconference
	June – Business Meeting -- Marlborough Central Fire Station if allowed

Share a Shack!

Editor’s Note: Welcome to the first in a new MMRA Feature Series:  sharing a member’s ham shack.  With the current COVID situation many of us are becoming used to ZOOMing rather than meeting in person.  Seeing various shacks in the video backgrounds made me curious.  If you have a shack you are willing to share, let me know.  Complex shack or simple, fixed or mobile, new ham or oldie like me, I’m sure that we are all curious about other’s shacks.  And this will give us all a way to steal ideas from each other — a basic premise of Ham Radio.  The feature will appear based on your input!   Larry, W1DYJ

Bryan, W1BRI, the MMRA’s Technical Officer Emeritus (and still very involved in keeping all of our stuff operating) and currently a repeater trustee, graciously agreed to be the first to do so.  

PHOTO - My Computer Desk
and HT collection
PHOTO - The Milford UHF Repeater /    6 Meter Remote Base /    Echolink / APRS Station
PHOTO - My bedside ham radio / scanner console.
PHOTO - Scanner VGA mini projector setup on top of light as a stand to project ProScan application running on Asus net book onto wall above TV. This is so I don’t have to keep turning my head every time towards the scanner to see what is being received.
PHOTo - Repeater backup battery, chargers and 1500VA UPS to keep Liva mini PC, Asus netbook and scanners running for 3 hours upon AC power loss. Also have another big battery on piece of wood with furniture sliders and DieHard 750W invertor that I pull around on the rug to have AC power where I might want it during a blackout. Astron supply is for running my Icom 706 MII G.

Bryan will be happy to tell you what all of the detailed stuff is — just ask him!
(Bryan also has 8 WiFi switches in many places so he can say “Alexa” turn on/off projector etc.)

CLUB ACTIVITIES – WHILE STAYING AT HOME

By Bruce Blain, K1BG, EMA Affiliated Club Coordinator (ACC)

What a difference a month makes! Eastern Massachusetts affiliated clubs have responded in a number of ways to the current Covid-19 crisis.  Some have simply shut their doors until the current crisis is over, which is understandable given the circumstances. Others have chosen to follow the Marine Corps slogan: improvise, adapt, and overcome.

For some clubs, a combination of club nets, repeaters, calling frequencies, and webinars continue to be used while meetings cannot be held.  While club nets, repeaters, and calling frequencies have been used by clubs for many years, the frequency and participation has picked up as a greater focus has been placed on them.  Some clubs are taking advantage of webinar products from WebEx, GoToMeeting, Amazon Chime, and Zoom, and have conducted webinars for both regular club meetings and board meetings.

For instance:
New England Sci-Tech recently had Mark Rudd, KC1LOM, speak regarding Titanic’s “Marconi Radio” and related broadcast history at their weekly Zoom meeting. The talk drew a crowd of over 50!

In addition to their weekly 2-meter repeater net on Tuesday and 10-meter net on Thursday, Wellesley ARA purchased a year’s subscription to Zoom Pro. I attended their webinar last week.  Turnout was heavy and there was a lot of participation by those in attendance.

There are many benefits to holding webinars right now. Participants who live physically distant from their clubs can participate, as can those with physical limitations. A much larger variety of guest speakers are available to speak if they don’t have to personally attend.  Want some great ideas for guest speakers, both during and after the Covid-19 crisis is over?  Click the “Club Speakers List” quicklink at https://ema.arrl.org/affiliated-clubs/.

While I am in no way endorsing one product or service over another, Zoom seems like a pretty popular teleconference service these days.  A free account will allow you to host a teleconference for up to 40 minutes for as many as 100 attendees. For $14.99 per month you can host a teleconference for 100 people for 24 hours. For more information, go to https://zoom.us/pricing.

If you are looking for ideas as to how to move your club forward during the current Covid-19 crisis, please let me know. And let us know what your plans are so that we can keep this site up to date and share your activities with as many hams in eastern Massachusetts as we can.
