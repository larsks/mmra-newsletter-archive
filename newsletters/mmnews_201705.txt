Truths & Myths about Station Grounding 
Neil Goodell ~ AE1P  
Location: Leominster Emergency Management
              Talkin: 147.27
NOTE: This was originally scheduled for our March meeting, but was cancelled due to snow.

First introduced to Ham Radio at the age of 12, when I was given an old Knight R-100A, and a box full of 73 and Popular Electronics magazine.  Got sidetracked with the usual teenage activities, sports and trucks, and did not return back to Amateur Radio until 2002, when I started studying and passed my tech, receiving the call KB1KOX.  I then upgraded to general, while the 5 wpm code requirement was still in place, and Extra six months after that, and have enjoyed the Hobby ever since. 
One of the best experiences I have had concerning Amateur Radio was being the Site Supervisor for five sites during the 2014 WRTC event held in New England.  It was a lot of work but also a lot of fun, and a pleasure to meet and spend time with some of the best of the best in Amateur radio contesting.  As far as the hobby goes, I enjoy all aspects: contesting, ragchewing, rtty and digital, homebrewing and antenna building...there is so much to do, never a dull moment.
In my personal life I am a Master Electrician, spent 20+ years as an Electrical Foreman in commercial projects, mostly in Hospitals and Power Plants, and now am the Electrician for the City of Keene in the Utilities Division.
Being an Electrician, I had already known of the importance of Grounding, and, using that to tie in directly to Amateur radio: How important Grounding is to our “Radio Shacks”, as far as lightning protection and RF grounding.  I look forward to sharing the importance of grounding to your group on the 15th.

President’s Corner ~ David Wolfe, KG1H

Annual Election of Officers

The time has come for all good hams (members) to come to the aide of their organization: the Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA).  Operating the MMRA is no simple task as its infrastructure is comprised of 22 VHF and UHF repeater systems located across eastern and central Massachusetts linked together by several communication modes.    The MMRA officers are always looking for new volunteers with varied expertise, and members are welcome to attend and contribute at the Board meetings.

It is May and election of officers is upon us.  Like a commercial corporation, albeit non-profit, the operation of the MMRA Corporation is controlled by a set of bylaws requiring personnel with multiple expertise, all of which are dedicated volunteers.  The MMRA Board of Directors consists of the Executive Board, and the repeater trustees.  The Executive Board includes nine elected members of the Corporation, five of which shall be the officers of the Corporation. The remaining four members are directors.

The election procedure as described in the bylaws is summarized below:

	* Nomination by Individual:  Any member desiring to run for a particular elective position shall notify the Secretary of such intention on or before April 15 
	* Publication of Nominations: The Secretary shall, on or before one week prior to the May meeting, distribute to the membership a complete list of all candidates eligible for election at the annual meeting. 
	* The Executive Board will be elected by the membership at the annual meeting of the Corporation in May. 
	* Election Procedures: At the annual meeting, the President shall announce to the membership the names of those candidates eligible for each of the various elective positions.

Only paid members may vote at any meeting of the membership. 

Note that we will also be voting to approve the purchase of a duplexer for our 6M repeater and hearing a great presentation from Neil Goodell, AE1P, about Station grounding.

Treasurer Report May 2017 ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP


The MMRA fiscal year ends soon on May 31.  The fiscal year about to end was called 2016-2017.  The fiscal year which will start on June 1 will be called 2017-2018.  The membership year (dues) ends on August 31.

Most of the spending for this year has already occurred but there is some additional spending which may occur, for example if the membership approves the $1000 for the 6M repeater duplexor at the meeting on May 17.

The MMRA will run in the red this fiscal year.  This is primarily due to the $6000 investment into another round of Larcan TV transmitter amplifiers which we hope to sell in the future.  For those who are new, or who forgot, the MMRA has had  a lot of income since 2009 selling these amplifiers.  Indeed these sales have financed a great deal of improvements to the system and its infrastructure since 2009.  If not for this investment this year we would be more than $3000 in the black for the year.

Expenditures greater than $500 must be approved by the membership.  Expenditures less than $500 can be approved by the board.  There are some expenses which were approved by the board or by the membership which have not actually yet been spent and may not be spent this fiscal year.  

The MMRA received about $3000 in donations this year.  Some of that was donations of money but much of it was donations of material which was sold (usually on eBay and usually by K1IW).  The material donations include coax donated by K1RJZ and a computer material donation which was made available by N1DDK.  Total income so far is about $9400.   About $6000 of that income is from dues and about $1600 of that are dues for next year.

This year the MMRA had 230 paid memberships.  That is actually a high during the time I have been involved with the club (since about 1998).

The MMRA pays for electricity at the MRW and QCY sites.   Last year (not this year) this totaled almost $2000.  However due to replacing some of the power supplies at MRW this amount was reduced by about $600 this year (and for future years).   MMRA has only been paying for electricity at QCY since the fall of 2013.

Detailed financial information is presented at almost every business meeting.  These meetings generally occur in the months which do not have general membership meetings.  They are announced on the www.mmra.org website and in this newsletter.  All members are invited to these meetings.  Of course much more than the finances are discussed at these meetings including repeater status, repeater decisions, planning, etc...

The MMRA has been very lucky to have had a dedicated and stable group of officers without a lot of turnover for more than 10 years.  However that will not last forever and it will be important for new and different individuals to be elected and hold these positions in future years.  I strongly encourage anyone interested, new members and old (and hopefully younger members) to get more involved with this aspect of the organization.  The MMRA is responsible for a great deal of assets which were assembled through the efforts of many individuals over many years including our 12 repeater sites and 23 repeaters.  These assets belong to the Massachusetts ham community and need to be preserved and protected for future generations.

April Business Meeting
Bob Evans, Clerk, N1BE

The MMRA Board met on April 19th at New England AirGun in Hudson at 7:00 PM.  In attendance were N1DDK, K1KWP, KG1H, WA1MDD, N1NVK, W1DYJ, N1BE and K1IW.
Kevin, K1KWP provided a Treasurer's Report.  The current fiscal year ends at the end of May.  We have been able to sell some of the recycled equipment recently acquired.  This has netted a few hundred dollars to the MMRA.  K1KWP reviewed spending to date and more than half went to fund this year's Larcan venture.  Kevin also reviewed membership numbers.  We have a higher number of paid memberships than any of the previous 10 years.
Bob, K1IW reported on the status of several repeaters:
Hopkinton won't link.  K1IW plans to investigate.
Bob went to Quincy and the FreedomPop modem did not receive any 3G signal at the repeater.  The thick stone walls of the building seem to be the problem.  We discussed alternatives for a better signal at that site.  Several of the officers plan to try some alternatives at that site in May.  Bob also has a cooling fan to add to the repeater.  In addition, we need to replace the padlock on the door that was broken.  It seems that our alarm may have scared someone from attacking the inner door.  (But maybe not, if it was a town employee.)
In North Reading, the audio is still distorted.
The 147.27 link radio times out, making communication 1-way.  N1NVK suggested checking the time-out timer on the link transmitter.
We received a $1000 quoted price to purchase the 6-meter duplexer that has been on loan at MRE.  The membership will be asked to approve this at the May meeting.
In addition, Bob reported on the status of items that are being sold by the MMRA:
There are many failed transistors in the TV channel 5 Larcan amps MMRA recently purchased for resale.  K1IW had bought a few replacement transistors.  At present we do not have enough to repair all the amps.  We also discussed possible conversion to 2-meter conversion of some of the amps -- this gives an amp that could be sold for perhaps $200 more after hours of work.  Due to the unexpected poor condition of these amps, it will take a lot of work to profit from this venture.  There was one other buyer, in Canada, who wanted these amps.  Bob will investigate a bulk sale of all the amps, the few replacement transistors and the shipping crate to our competitor.  Consensus of board was to accept a loss of a few hundred dollars to be done with this ill-fated project.
We have sold a few rolls of 1-5/8 inch hardline coax; there are several more for sale.  The BARRA club responded to our offer of hardline, but did not indicate whether they need it.  Bob drove to CT to deliver some of the hardline, only to have the items refused by the buyer who expected a different type of cable.
MMRA will be offering the hardline and other surplus equipment for sale at flea markets.   This weekend Dave and Clark will be at the MMRA table in Framingham.  And K1IW plans to be at NEARFest.
KG1H and K1IW led a discussion about speakers for future meetings.  No definite decisions were made.  As the schedule is finalized the agenda will be announced in future newsletters and on the MMRA web site.  Possibly the September meeting will be at the Boxboro convention like last year.
Dave discussed nominations for the election of MMRA officers in May.  According to our bylaws, the nominations have to be finalized by May 1.  At present we have this slate:

President: 		Dave, KG1H
Vice-President:		John, WA1MDD
Treasurer: 		Kevin, K1KWP
Secretary:        	John, W1JMC 
Clerk:                 
Director:         	Bob, K1IW
Director:         	Roger, WA1NVC 

Finally we considered the Boxboro convention.  John, WA1MDD offered to coordinate MMRA group dinner tables for Saturday evening.  This will probably be done via e-mail.  The board approved an expenditure of up to $400 for purchase of raffle prizes.  K1IW plans to purchase these items at Dayton.
The meeting adjourned at 9:02 PM.

————————
Addenda: On May 1, via an e-mail ballot, the board approved an expenditure of $491 to upgrade the North Reading repeater controller and make it accessible from the Internet.
