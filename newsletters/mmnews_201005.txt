Public Service
Bruce Pigott —  KC1US — Public Service Coordinator

Operating at Public Service events has a certain flow to it and certain procedures.  First, the communications involve setting up of the route and water stops. Then participants start with the more athletic types at the front.  A rising tide of participants follows, then a tapering, which slows down to a trickle and picking up of supplies and equipment. The messages are of tactical nature and do not need the formal requirements of the National Traffic System.  Since these events happen during the warmer weather, it is usually a nice day to be outside, not cutting the grass. It is a less stressful way to learn the features of your radio and practice setting up of equipment.  

Depending on the size of the event you may be part of a team or by yourself.  At the Boston Marathon, the Red Cross aid stations are staffed with three operators —  important due to the amount of communications at times.  It also allows less experienced hams to learn from those with more experience. After being at a few events, you will be the only communicator at a location, and most of the other event volunteers helping will have less experience than you. 

Here are a few tips based on listening to communications at events through the years:

Use plain language - Q signals, Morse code prosigns, and funny phonetics are unnecessary on voice channels and reduce message comprehension. 

Push to talk, Wait to talk - All repeaters have delay.  Some have more transmit delay than others, especially linked systems. 

Take it off your belt.  Leaving your hand held radio next to your body will cause up to a 15dB loss in transmit power.  Your two watts are reduced to only 1/16 of a watt. 

Upcoming event: June 26 and 27 is the MS150 Cape Cod Getaway scenic bicycle tour from Quincy to Provincetown. As it is on Field Day weekend, there is a lot of competition for operators. See the list at the end of this newsletter for contact details. One club that is looking for more support at a number of events is the Boston Amateur Radio Club. Their calendar is listed in the current newsletter available at
http://www.barc.org/.

President’s Corner

Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

As always, we will be wrapping up the MMRA calendar year with our May meeting.  We will be meeting at the Clay Center Observatory in Brookline where a member of the observatory staff will brief us in developments in astronomy and in particular one aspect of their work there.

After this meeting, the MMRA doesn't completely go to sleep however.  Summertime weather allows us to complete infrastructure projects that we don't get to when it's cold.  Look for our new 7330 controllers to come online at our HUB1 and HUB2 repeaters.  The existing 7K controllers that
are at these sites will be redeployed to our Hopkinton and Southborough sites.  Also on the list is an upgrade to our 10m transmitter antenna location in Marlborough.  It will be moved from its low spot on a storage building to the top of the crank-up mast - an increase of approximately 30 feet.

Finally, look for the MMRA suite at the Boxboro convention in August.  We  will be providing talk-in for the convention.  The suite also has a member's reception area with soft drinks and light snacks for members.  The suite is also a great way to renew your membership in person.  Members who renew for two years at the convention also receive three free tickets to the MMRA convention raffle, where this year's prizes include an MFJ antenna analyzer, an Alinco 222 MHz HT, and possibly some other great items.  Even if you don't renew, or if you do but want to purchase additional tickets, the raffle tickets are sold for $2 each, 3 for $5, or 7 for $10.  Tickets are only available for purchase at the convention.  The drawing is held in our suit just before we shut down the main convention drawing.  You need not be present to win.

If you are not going to attend the convention, you can still renew your membership online from our club website.  All memberships run September through August, so why not take the opportunity to renew today for next year!?

Digital Update ~ How to connect via Echolink or IRLP

Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

MMRA repeaters are on automatic schedulers which allow the network to reconfigure on its own several times during the week.  On Tuesdays at 8PM, most MMRA repeaters link together for the MMRA Technical Information and Other Stuff net.  On other weeknights, they link up at 10PM for the Heavy Hitters traffic net.  The links disconnect just before midnight.  To see which repeaters link up, see our website: http://www.mmra.org/repeaters, then click on "Table View".

The 900 MHz repeaters are normally linked to the NEAR-900 net, a collection of 900 MHz systems tied to IRLP reflector 9125.  On Tuesdays, the 449.925 and the two 900 machines link together through IRLP reflector 9122.  

If you want to join our net on Tuesday nights, you will not be able to connect directly to the HUB.  Instead, connect to the New England reflector.  This reflector can also be reached via EchoLink at *NEW-ENG2* or IRLP node 9127.  The reflector allows a lot more Echolink users than our HUBs node can, as well as allowing the 900 MHz repeaters to be linked.  For more information on the New England reflector, go to http://new-eng.com.

March Membership Meeting

The March Members Meeting was held at the MEMA bunker in Framingham on 24 March.  Featured speaker was Ed Hare, W1RFI, ARRL Lab Manager, who told us about the latest activities at the ARRL Lab.  Here are some photos from the night:

With the successful completion of the Larcan Amplifier Fundraiser, President Bob, K1IW, presents Rick, K1RJZ, with a “Thank You” — a plaque and a $50 gift certificate.  

Other awardees include  Mike Keller, Dave Beauvais, Doug Durkee, and Robert Maw.

SKYWARN Storm Spotter training ~ Steve Telsey, N1BDA

There will be a SKYWARN Storm Spotter training class May 15 at Concord Academy, in the Ransome room of the Math and Arts Center which is located across from the Gym. Concord Academy is located at 166 Main Street in Concord.  Parking at the school is limited; however, there is a municipal parking lot off of Main Street on Keyes Road.  The training is scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM.

Rob Macedo, KD1CY a 15-year veteran of the NWS SKYWARN program will be the presenter. The program covers topics such as hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, down bursts and other summer and winter weather events. This highly informative and timely program will also provide information on identifying cloud formations, identifying hail sizes and estimating wind speed.
This program is open to all and will be of particular interest to anyone who enjoys outside activities such as sports, camping, boating or is just interested in learning more about the weather.  This program will also cover safety tips that are appropriate during severe weather events.

The workshop is free, the multi-media presentation is captivating, and the handouts (new this spring) are excellent and informative reference materials.  At the end of the program participants will have the opportunity to join the National Weather Service SKYWARN Spotters Program.

Please pass the word and encourage hams and non-hams alike to join us on May 15.

March 6 Foxhunt Results
Charlie Suprin, AA1VS 

The call of the fox lured many a hunter out from their winter den.  The fox hid on the Weston 146.790 repeater while the hunters used their traditional shotgun start.  The hunters cornered the fox at the end of Cranberry Circuit in Sudbury, near the borders of Sudbury, Maynard, Acton, and Concord.  After the first foxhunt, there was an optional second foxhunt on 902.5 simplex for the hunters.  This hunt brought out several teams and an interesting collection of hunting gear.

The teams found the primary fox in the following order.
1st Place at 11:05: N1OMJ, K1BOS, N1DIZ, N1TBN
2nd Place at 11:20: KB1TEH, KB1REQ, NI1X
3rd Place at 11:52: W1/VK3MD
4th Place at 11:53: WB1W
5th Place at 12:35: KB1NXM

The hunters used varied tools in their hunt.  Tape measure yagis were common.  One Doppler system appeared. L-per and ARDF gear also appeared.  Also most stations were able to copy the 900MHz fox using either an extended receive amateur radio, a scanner or modified commercial equipment.

Back row left to right: Dennis Ditto N1DIZ, John Mullaney K1BOS, Alan Marchioni N1TBN and Bob Rogers WA1PIO - the fox. Front kneeling left to right: Charlie Suprin AA1VS Assistant Fox and Mike Giovannucci N1OMJ.
