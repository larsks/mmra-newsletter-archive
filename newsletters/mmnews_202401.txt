A 10m FM Antenna to fit into my Attic — Larry Banks, W1DYJ

This is a Hybrid meeting: New England SciTech + ZOOM

Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

In my role as the MMRA TIaOS Net Manager, I should be able to monitor all of our
repeaters.  I didn’t have 10m FM capability.

I have a homebrew 6m FM ground plane in my attic to monitor the MMRA 6m repeater.  I decided to put a 10m FM antenna in my attic without adding another coax run.  The
attic height is ~5’ and a 10m ground plane is at least 8’ tall with ~16’ diameter radials, so I had to shorten both the height and the length of the radials.

And how do I feed it in parallel with the 6m GP?  This gave me an opportunity to learn about using coax as a matching network.   This is the story.

Larry was licensed in 1962 as novice KN1VFX and became W1DYJ in 1966.  From 1969 to 1985 he was an engineer and
project manager for Hewlett-Packard Medical R&D in Waltham and Andover MA, involved in developing diagnostic cardiac equipment.  In 1985 he was asked to organized the cardiac R&D lab’s CAD environment and the SW Testing and Quality group, along with managing the Printed Circuit Layout group, the technical library, ongoing technical education, and ISO9001 as the R&D Section Manager for “R&D Process Improvement.” In 1993 he moved to HP Medical Education to be responsible for technical and project management training. When Agilent split out of HP in 1995, he became Agilent 
Technology’s global program manager for their Learning Management System.  He “retired” in 2005 and then consulted for Avago Technologies (now Broadcom) on eLearning technologies through 2012. 

Larry holds three degrees in EE from MIT. He spends his time chasing DX and contesting in Woburn, traveling with his wife Maren and attending as many jazz and classical concerts as they can.  He is the net manager and newsletter editor for the MMRA, publications editor for HamXposition, a member of the YCCC, and a member of the Merrymeeting ARA in mid-coast Maine where they used to have a 2nd home in Harpswell.

15 November 2023 Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:35 PM 

Email Vote for Repair for of Prudential Repeater: 
Please login to the www.mmra.org and cast your vote if you have not done so
103 people have voted as of an hour before the start of this meeting.

Emergency Fund:
What is it?
$3,000 emergency fund that can be used for repairs only of an existing repeater..
Requires Board approval.
History and why we need it?
Originally approved in 2018 after .925 died and meeting to vote was cancelled by a nor’easter.
.925 was down for a couple of months.
Why didn’t we vote on it in May?
Those of us on the Board forgot to add it to the agenda and no one caught the mistake.
Emergency Fund vote is supposed to occur on our May Meeting
Why can’t we vote now (like the Newsletter announced)?
Newsletter announcement had to be published 7 days before the next meeting, according to the by-laws.

Repeater Status Report: - Bob DeMattia – K1IW

Boston Prudential Repeater 146.82 – is off the air. The new repeater has been installed, but there is a problem with the antenna. Club vote is in progress to approve up to $3K expense. We need to add a 2nd feedline and the Pru has given us permission to do so.
[Editor:  this is now resolved and 146.82 is back on the air, better than ever.]

Brookline – Remote RX has been removed. The DSTAR repeater is still there.

Weston – The 146.79 2M – Status has not changed. SWR is still 2:1 at the radio end. Since the weather was not cooperative at the Campion Center on the 9/26 visit with NN1C, this will have to wait until Spring.

10m Repeater – Weston – After some tuning, receiver breaks squelch at -119dBm, an 11dB improvement, still not great. Bernie, N1IMO, the owner of the linked NH repeater network and also owner of two-way radio company in Nashua, is donating a Kenwood TK-6110 as a possible replacement receiver. Bob will be picking it up today. If this radio has better sensitivity, it will replace the aging Mastr II receiver and will be wiring it in a few days.

North Reading –146.715 – Replacement is ready to install – scheduled to be done on Saturday, December 2nd.

Burlington – 224.88 - Bob suspects drop-outs occur when there is doubling/heterodyning
on ‘925. It appears the ‘88 link decoder is more sensitive to this than others. Still need to try putting the link radio in CSQ mode for during the TIOS Net.

900 MHz Repeater – 927.0625 W1OG has informed us that he has picked up the 900 MHz Quantars and is checking them out before handing them over to the club. WA1NVC has volunteered to do the set-up work on it.

Belmont – 145.43 –EX-BELMONT – is off the air due to loss of site. Board to discuss options at the December meeting. This repeater will be rebuilt before it is installed at its new location. The second Kenwood repeater, which was intended as the Mendon replacement, will probably be used for this. Joe Weisse, W1HAI, suggested the MMRA send the family who had graciously allowed the repeater to remain on their property, (until selling their home) a “Thank You” from us on their generosity.

Future Projects – In addition to the TK-6110 mentioned above, N1IMO is donating two Motorola Quantor VHF repeaters to the club. If these check out, they can be used to upgrade the remaining VHF Mastr II’s that are running Mendon and Marlborough West.

Presentation 

A Smorgasbord of Radio – The People, Places and Incidents – By Dom Mallozzi, N1DM

This historical research covered 13 Scientists and Engineers starting in 1864 that contributed to the development of radio and telephony communications that most take for granted. Starting with James Clerk Maxwell (1857-1894 UK) who developed a set of mathematical equations citing radio waves existed mathematically and are known today as “Maxwell’s Equations”. Developing further was Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 Germany) who demonstrated the existence of radio waves in 1886 by producing electric sparks. His research was the foundation of frequency set by international agreement on Weights and Measures. Others followed like Marconi, Dr. Karl Braun, Nikola Tesla, Lee De Forest, Reginand Fessenden, John Stone Stone, Greenleaf Pickard, and Edwin Armstrong, as radio signals developed from tonal sounds, to remote control, to voice and eventually long distance worldwide communications. Companies like RCA, GE and AT&T and many other businesses developed from the work of these great scientists and engineers.

The Places: Siaconset, Nantucket, MA., Point Judith & Block Island, RI., Brant Rock, Marshfield, MA; Bar Harbor, Belfast, Houlton, ME; and Chatham & Marion MA; are deep in the historical development of radio communications ranging from ship to shore transmission to across the ocean and laying of the transatlantic cable which started with telephony and later voice communication. The transatlantic telephone receiver used SSB on approximately 60 KHz. Later a transatlantic phone call from NYC to London, which was not a direct route, cost $529 per minute, which is equivalent to $2,646 in 2023. Please note this summary here leaves out an enormous amount of details that was fascinating to us as Dom presented his slides. 

The Real QRO Station: Is a US Navy Radio Station, NAA, in Cutler, ME that started in 1961 with a very low frequency transmitter around 24 KHz with a power of 2 Megawatts. The antenna is 75 miles of wire on 26 towers. 

Events: The most known incident was the Titanic which sank on April 14, 1912 where 1,514 died and only 710 were saved after the RMS Carpathia responded to a wireless distress call. That horrific tragedy resulted in major changes in radio operations where monitoring is constantly performed. Another standard was “SOS” as the only accepted international distress call. 

Again, I strongly recommend viewing Dom’s entire slide deck below. Consider this summary cursory.

Annual TIaOS Net Report ~ Larry Banks, W1DYJ

[A graph of the annual average attendance, 2007 - 2023]

In 2023 weekly participation was around 18.  The largest participation during 2023 was on both 28 February and 25 April, with 26 check-ins. I want to thank Tom, KB1OQA; Ed, KC1CLA; Kevin, K1KWP; and Jonathan, K1BTZ for being net controls during this past year.  We all hope to hear you Tuesday nights at 8 pm.   And we would be HAPPY to have you (any of you…) volunteer to be a Back-Up NC!!!    We have a script you can use..  All of our current NCs would welcome you to the “club.”

Keeping Amateur Radio Alive ~ Stephen Babbitt – KC1LPZ

For some species extinction is gradual, not necessarily from the footprint of man. Nature has a
demanding and cruel way of separating the fit from the unfit whether it is fair to those that are on the path to obliteration or survival. Man may believe it can one day control nature’s destiny, but we have yet to solve our own destiny of peacefully coexisting with one another. 

Let’s relate this to the hobby we love so dearly: Ham Radio. Can we attract and excite the next
generation to our great pastime that we cherish so passionately?  Can we convey the enjoyable
memories and experiences Ham Radio has enriched our own lives?  If we can articulate our passion, our hobby will live far beyond our time on this planet. 

How passionate are you to pass along what we do? We don’t need to form a committee to study the causes on why our numbers are decreasing, We have, inadvertently, let the next generation stare
aimlessly into their smart phones and computers, where they perceive they can contact the world and our endless libraries of information at the touch of their modern technology. There is some truth to that notion. But what critical thinking have we shared to help them discriminate between fact and fantasy? Social media is a cesspool where humans and non-human bots can interact with many vulnerable
individuals becoming susceptible to being gaslighted. 

Ham Radio by contrast means all of us are licensed and must follow the basic guidelines to communicate with one another. This is the right to be on the air rather than sitting in someone’s basement
anonymously behind a keyboard. Now add that Hams can communicate in any number of hazardous situations, like power outages: we can remain on the air without the internet or cell phones. Being
identifiable by our callsign we are more likely to be careful with the information we pass on to others. Ham Radio operators do not have all the answers, but we do care to help others when they may need assistance. 

What better thrill chatting with someone locally or far off on the other side of our country or globe to learn something new, or to just develop friendships that you are likely to have when your travels result in their local vicinity. Last September, for example, I was at a business conference in Phoenix Arizona, to wind up connecting up with the Vice President of the Arizona Amateur Television Network Group,
meeting his family and joining in on a birthday celebration of one of his aunts who just turned 89 and shared her phenomenal artwork with me. How many of you would have loved to take a break from parts of a routine conference with a local ham radio friend, his family and enjoy the local area that I likely would not have seen? Be honest: that is really cool. 

Ham Radio offers so much more. It is high time we put our thoughts together and share it with the next generation. Growing our hobby is simple. If each of us can add one more individual to our ranks, our
survival and growth are inevitable.

449.575 Hopkinton / 448.225 DSTAR to swap frequencies first week of March

Bob DeMattia, K1IW

In early March, the frequencies of Hopkinton analog and Marlborough DSTAR will be swapped.  When complete, Hopkinton will be on 448.225 and the Marlborough DSTAR will be on 449.575.   The reason for this is to reduce interference on the Hopkinton site.   When Hopkinton is linked, it must receive the HUB1 output of 449.925 while transmitting on 449.575.   This is a 350KHz separation.  By swapping the frequencies, the separation will be 1.7 MHz.    Both repeaters will be off the air for a short time (a few hours) while the swap is being done.

20 December 2023 Business Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:33 PM 

MMRA Secretary Position Opening
Jason – W1HFP – has indicated he will not run for Secretary next year
The Board wants to identify candidates for this position.
The new secretary will need to be trained.
Duties:
     * Process new and renewal memberships (working with the Treasurer and the VE Team).
     * Publish the newsletter to the MMRA website.
     * Attend Business Meetings
     * Respond to any email regarding membership issues.
A motion was made that Dave and Kevin will be performing the duties as Acting Secretary, which was passed unanimously.

AREDN Update
Roger – WA1NVC – attended an AREDN meeting and reports the Mass AREDN group must focus on its primary mission: setting up their communication system to increase interest and usage of the MESH network.

Repeater Status Report: - Bob DeMattia – K1IW

Belmont Relocation — Various sites in Belmont were suggested, all of which will mean starting from scratch cold calling people in Belmont. 
To that end, Bob is working with Ed Curley who will approach the Emergency Management Director for Belmont to determine if we can interest him in having a Ham Radio Repeater. 
Since the installation probably can’t happen until Spring, Bob thinks we should take the time to find a good site and not just use a site we have because it is there. 

Brookline – WA1NVC suggested we replace the DSTAR in Brookline with 145.43. We will need to reinstall a link antenna and feedline. We suspect the main antenna feedline may be damaged. So this is not as trivial as it may sound.
We could probably move 145.16 back to Marlborough East, which makes it sort of redundant with the UHF machine. Also, 145.16 is the only Boston-area D-Star system currently available. Bob suggests we should make an extra effort to find a different site.
W1HAI suggests we could find a site in Middleborough.

Quincy 2m .67 Repeater – On last night’s TIOS Net the repeater failed to link up to the network. Currently Quincy 2m repeater has been disconnected from Hub1. Some technical issues persist requiring onsite maintenance. Bob is waiting for the City of Quincy to response to his initial contact attempt. This is not a high priority because .82 on the Pru has pretty much similar coverage.

North Reading — On Saturday, 12/2 the first Kenwood NXR-710 was installed. 

Belmont Repeater — Until a new location is found, the second Kenwood NXR710 will be part of the Belmont rebuild. The NXR-710 is necessary for Belmont because its receiver can go down to 144 MHz. The Quantars cannot without difficult modifications. 

Hopkinton — Tone Problem: The output tone on Hopkinton had to be disabled because the transmitter (on 449.575) gets into the link receiver (on 449.925).
This is a 350 KHz difference. One possible solution would be to change the frequency of Hopkinton to a lower frequency. Several are available in the low 448 MHz range.
Hopkinton is fully synthesized, so the only work that would need to be done would be to set the new frequency and tune the duplexers.
While no official vote was taken, the Board is receptive to changing the Hopkinton frequency. 

Donated Equipment
In addition to donating the TK6110 for the new 10m receiver, N1IMO, also donated two fully functional Motorola Quantar repeaters (like the one we put up at the Pru). 
Bob is recommending we designate these as the replacements for Marlborough West and Mendon, which are our last two VHF Mastr II’s.
The largest expense Bob sees here is for the battery backup on 147.27. The Quantar requires 24V for its battery input, which is done with two 12V btteries in series. We currently have only one.
Other than that, Bob doesn’t see a lot of other expenses in getting these replacements ready to install. Both systems are operating without issues, so there is no rush to do this, but it won’t hurt to get them ready to go. 
Lowell Hub2 Problem
For similar reasons, the Lowell repeater on 442.250 is not linkable to HUB2. This is because its transmit frequency is 450 KHz away from the receive frequency of 442.7.
Lowell could work correctly with a change to a 446-448 frequency as well. Lowell is a little trickier because it is crystal controlled Mastr II and it is less than trivial to take a Mastr II with high RX, low TX and flip it. 
Perhaps, if the club someday approves a replacement repeater for 442.250, we could change the frequency at the same time, except for the special-case repeaters on 10m, 6m, and Brookline DSTAR.

Linking Issue Summary
A discussion on the linking issue primarily came from Roger and Kevin with Kevin asking if we could just change the frequency to HUB2 to solve the problem with Lowell and Hopkinton?  Roger thought that was a good idea. They will discuss it in greater detail with Bob later on. Bob expressed some reservations with no resolution finalized at tonight’s meeting as this is a work in progress.

Equipment List — In summary, a  spreadsheet – 5 pages – was presented listing what the MMRA has and where these pieces of equipment are located.

Treasurer’s Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year. On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank people below who donated since my list in the November newsletter: 

         KC1PWO, W1HAI, K5TEC, KB1LKR

As of this writing there are 177 paid members for the 2023-2024 year. At this point 51 people would need to join or renew to reach parity with the 2022-2023 year (which ended on Aug 31, 2023).  One hundred (100) members have not yet renewed and as of Jan 1, 2024 these memberships have expired. Those members will likely not see this newsletter until the March Newsletter is available if they renew!

The funds balance was $22193.93 on June 1,2023. At this writing on Dec 30, 2023 the balance is $18088.97 . Based on all the information I have I predict the balance on June 1,2024 is likely to be $18493.48. This assumes we get the 51 new memberships/renewals to reach parity with last year. This also assumes the membership and/or board do not approve any additional significant spending not already known.

As noted in the previous newsletter N1CTY donated a bunch of radio equipment to the club. We will be attempting to sell this at the upcoming Marlboro flea:
BTech UV25-X4 Mobile, Beofang F8-HP HT, Kenwood THF-6A HT, Tram 2-band base antenna,
Ed Fong 1-band base antenna, and a Pyramid 10amp Power Supply.   There are also many HT antennas and accessories including large capacity batteries, drop in charger, USB programming cables for the above.  

If you are interested in any of the above before the flea send email to contact@mmra.org.  Reasonable market based offers only please. However keep in mind that we want to avoid paying eBay fees, PayPal fees, postage, shipping costs, etc… so feel free to take that into account :-).

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (449.575) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
