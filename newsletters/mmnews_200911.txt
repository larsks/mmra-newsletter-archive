Public Service and the MMRA
Bruce, KC1US — Public Service Coordinator 

One of the objectives of the Minuteman Repeater Association is to be active in Public Service.  Due to repeater locations and linking, the systems themselves are called on many times.  

First, there are some large scale events.  In April is the Boston Athletic Association Marathon which links Marlboro, Weston and Quincy machines with Belmont operating independently.  These are used to link about 150 radio operators at Red Cross Aid Stations and water stops along the race course.  A consortium of clubs organizes this event with many MMRA members in lead roles.  

For the Marathon Walk in October Marlboro, Brookline, Quincy are linked.  Belmont also fills in a few spots.  

At the Walk for Hunger in May and the Head of the Charles Regatta in October, Belmont and Brookline repeaters are used, which gives good coverage of the Boston, Cambridge and Newton areas for hand held users.

Other smaller events include talk in for the Algonquin ARC flea market, the Run of the Charles Canoe and Kayak Race and the Minuteman bicycle tour for the Multiple Sclerosis Society.  Events taper off in the winter, but will be back in the spring.  Keep tuned to this space

MMRA October Board of Directors Meeting
Bob Evans — N1BE — Clerk

Bob Evans — N1BE — Clerk

The MMRA board met at 19:00 EDT on October 21 at Stratus Technologies in Maynard, MA.  Present were K1KWP, WA1NVC, K1IW, W1MPN, KC1US, W3EVE, N1BDA, W1DYJ, K1RJZ and N1BE.

K1KWP spoke first with a Treasurer and membership report.  Kevin has a new format for graphically presenting this information.  He reviewed anticipated expenditures for this year and historic expenses for the last 5 years.  The report showed income broken down by sources for this year and the past 5 years.  We also reviewed power usage and changes to the telephone service at MRW where DSL is now installed for linking the 900MHz repeater via the Internet.

Bob, K1IW led a discussion of repeater status that covered only the few repeaters now having problems:

224.400 in Quincy is off the air.

146.67 in Quincy is receiving "Buzz-Buzz" interference.  This sounds like the kind of problem that Bryan eventually figured out in Marlboro -- sporadic unintended radiation from a cordless phone charger.  This will probably require a fox hunting effort at a time when the interference is active.

We brainstormed steps for determining the cause of de-sense to 146.82, Brookline.  When transmitting, a signal appears on the 146.22 MHz input frequency.  This problem is present all the time.

Newsletter issues were next discussed.  There was a suggestion for a new column on current public service events and which MMRA resources were expected to be in use.

K1KWP will not be available to fold and mail the next newsletter.  N1BE agreed to do this with the following assistance:  W3EVE will print and supply address labels; K1IW will supply a list of expired members; N1BE will create an insert reminding expired members to renew as otherwise they will get no future newsletters.

New business items were next discussed.

The board wants to thankfully recognize KB1OEI for transporting the new MRW shelter from Maine to Marlborough. Although it is a small token compared to Keith's time and expenses, the board voted unanimously to at no cost extend Keith's membership for the next year.

Linking of the 900MHz MRW repeater was next discussed.  DSL with a VOIP phone line has been installed with the intention to replace the previous Verizon POTS phone line.  The VOIP phone has been connected to the HUB1 controller.  The DSL will be used for IRLP connection to 900MHz.  K1IW supplied a computer for IRLP.  Thanks to K1RJZ, GEMOTO paid for the cost of a memory module and a specialized IRLP board.  The board voted unanimously to accept the donation from GEMOTO.

145.16 D-Star in Boston was briefly discussed.  K1IW expressed some concern about potential for interference to adjacent analog channels.  Bob supplied a computer and cables for the D-Star software.  WA1WOK supplied media containing the D-Star software.  N3HFK will install the OS and application software.  Internet access at the repeater site will be available at no cost.

Boston 900 MHz is receiving noise from Part-15 devices.  A trial of moving the input to the low end of the band was proposed.  The board unanimously approved a temporary move of the input frequency to 902.0125 MHz to avoid this interference.  The board also unanimously approved the following: If the test on 902.0125 MHz is successful, to apply at the Nov 7th NESMC meeting for coordination on this frequency, with possible TX frequency change to maintain the usual 25 MHz split.  Several of the MMRA board members confirmed their plans to attend that NESMC meeting.

N1BDA suggested we consider an MMRA policy for use of digital modes on analog repeaters.  The board passed this motion unanimously: The MMRA Network is intended for voice communications.  Digital transmissions on analog repeaters are not permitted except where authorized.  For experimenting, digital modes such as MT-63, PSK-31 and Olivia are only authorized on Belmont 145.43.  These transmissions must be accompanied by a voice ID.

Future meetings were discussed.  We are seeking speakers and meeting locations for January 20 and March 17.

Finally we had a round table discussion of Public Service events.  It was suggested that KC1US continue to notify the board and members of repeater usage in the two weeks before an event.  Use of twitter was also suggested as an easy way to get a notice on the MMRA web site.  K1KWP noted the newly released clarification of the rules from the FCC which confirmed that paid employees of a non-profit organization may not use Amateur Radio as a control operator to support a fund raising event.  W1MPN discussed interoperability and interference issues facing state and municipal agencies.

The meeting adjourned at 21:30.

19 September Foxhunt
Tim Shepard ~ KD1KY

On September 19, 2009, the MMRA Saturday morning foxhunt was held on the input (146.19) to the Weston 146.79 repeater.

Tim KD1KY was the fox and made 3 bonus transmissions before the official 10am start time.  The bonus transmissions around 9:40am and 9:45am were made while westbound on Route 9 in Newton.  The 9:55am bonus transmission was from the fox hiding location. Starting at 10:00am, 30-second long transmissions were made every 5 minutes.

The fox was located near the end of Riverside Road in Newton, parked in one of the parking slots next to the park.

Riverside Road is about 4 miles SE of the repeater site and is not shown on some maps.  It is a short dead-end road, only about 300 feet long, running parallel to and just south of the Mass Pike.  It connects to Charles Street to the east, and dead ends near the Charles River.  It is about a quarter mile east of Route 128.  It can only be reached by car by passing through the Charles Street tunnel underneath the Mass Pike.

Transmissions from Riverside Road were made using only 0.5W into a mag-mount antenna on the car.  The two earlier transmissions while traveling on Route 9 were made with higher power (perhaps 20W).

The fox was first found at 12:06pm by Briggs AB2NJ and Dick WB1W.  Next to find the fox was Charles AA1VS at 12:11pm.  And then Alan N1TBN and Mike N1OMJ arrived at 12:12pm.  Jonathan KB1SDS and Jonathan KC6F arrived at 12:25pm.

At 12:30pm the fox announced the location and the hunt ended.

New Shelter for Marlboro West

A new shelter for MRW was moved from Maine to Marlboro. Many thanks to N1KMA for donating the shelter and to Keith (KB1OEI) of Land's towing for transporting the shelter for the club!

24 October Foxhunt
Dick MacPherson ~ KB1W

It was a very dismal day. The ‘fox’ did not mind, as it was his day finally for another few hours of freedom before the hunters descend on him again. On a day like this, the ‘fox’ has some advantages over the hunters. He has a choice of staying under a roof and keeping dry, while the hunters are continually going out in the elements to take their bearings.

With such dismal conditions, he also takes advantage of yelling loud as his voice will propagate and reflect off the near by hills and create echoes thru the valleys below. Is this the day the fox sees final freedom?

At 10 AM on October 24, 2009 the hunt commenced. Today the hunting territory was centered on the Burlington Repeater with his hiding territory limited to a radius of 10 miles. The fox’s voice could be heard every 5 minutes for 30 seconds during the next hours. To the hunters this would often present a tease, always wishing for a little longer transmission. As the hunt went on it appeared that the weather & rain was causing problems with the signal they heard, as it would at times vary as reported.

The hunt continued and during the first hour the fox could hear the hunters going wildly around the countryside and at times away from his location. Yes, this may be the final day for freedom.

It was not just the hunters on the repeater, in addition, we heard from others (ex: W1GFF) at home reporting they are ‘Listening & Enjoying the Hunt’.

After an hour and twenty minutes the fox’s voice was getting sore from yelling so loud and reduced his power from 50 to 20 watts. Still there are no hunters showing themselves. The fox at times would try and tease the hunters with some subtle hints.

As the second hour mark approaches the fox gets braver and starts to give hints to taunt the hunters with his freedom he may soon enjoy forever.

Too smart he got, because at 12:20, the N1OMJ team (with N1TBN & AB1IC) came round the corner. The fox was found and his freedom had ended.

The ‘fox’ was finally located at Whip Hill Road in Stoneham.

The fox continued his transmissions and at 12:43, VK3MD came around the corner. He was soon followed up by AA1VS at 12:49.

By 1:00 the remaining hunters arrived at site and the hunting stories started to develop among the hunters. A few decided to continue the stories over lunch at Polcari’s in Woburn.

Despite the weather a good time was had by all.

Again would like to thank, the Minute Man Repeater Association, for use of their repeater during this hunt.

Although the fox has been captured again he will soon be released again. The first hunter, N1OMJ, who took the fox captive will be the fox on the next hunt. Stayed tuned, the details of the next hunt will be announced.

Join the fun and try your skills. Talk to a hunter, grab a ride or try on your own. You soon will be enjoying the sport of ‘fox hunting’.
