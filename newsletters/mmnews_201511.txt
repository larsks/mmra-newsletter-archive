About the Minuteman Repeater Association

The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur Radio and public service.  The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters in Eastern Massachusetts.

The MMRA meets (usually) on the 3rd Wednesday of each month from September to June.  Meeting times, locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this newsletter and on weekly nets.  Meetings are open to all interested parties.  Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in September, November, January, March, and May.  The intervening meetings are also open to all members and are for general business.

The Minuteman newsletter is Emailed one week before each general interest meeting.  Members are encouraged to submit articles which can be sent to the editor at 
newsletter@mmra.org.  The deadline for articles is the last Friday of the month preceding the meeting.

Each Tuesday evening at 8PM the MMRA links most of the repeaters for an open net.  The topic is “Technical Information and Other Stuff”.   Join us!

Membership in the MMRA is open to all radio amateurs.  Annual dues are $25 per individual or $35 per family.  See our website for details.

Email to the club leadership should be sent to 
contact@mmra.org. The MMRA maintains a web site at:  http://www.mmra.org/

An email distribution list for club members named “MMRA” is at: www.yahoogroups.com/.  

You can also follow us on twitter @mmraham and like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/mmraham.

MMRA QRM Policy

MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.  Measures are being taken to make audio recordings of repeater activity.

Ashland Half Marathon to use CCMCC

David Wolfe ~ KG1H

The Ashland Half Marathon (31 October) net control personnel are using the CCMCC that is 
being lent by the Clay Center.   The race officials are very enthusiastic about us using it.  Several young hams are helping out at the marathon with adult supervision from Bob Phinney, K5TEC

The Clay Center Mobile Command Center (CCMCC)

Photo 1
The CCMCC, owned and operated by the Clay Center Observatory at Dexter Southfield School, is equipped with an integrated shock-absorbing server rack with 4 Mac Minis running Windows 7 and OS X.  Thirteen articulating touch screen displays are permanently mounted and can be used for such things as operation of telescopes, displaying weather maps, data logging, radio operations, and accessing the Internet.

Photo 2
The CCMCC is equipped with GPS for position (APRS) and time,2m/70cm FM amateur radio station, NOAA weather radio with alert, a 2kW generator, 2kW inverter, networking, amplified cellular Internet. The 2” trailer hitch and large flat roof are ideal for mounting extra communications antennas for additional stations. In large events, 10x10 pop-up tents can be positioned at the side door and rear door to provide a sheltered place for spectators to gather and for information tables with literature.

The CCMCC can be used as a mobile amateur radio communications center.

Four work stations with dual displays in the back and two in the front provide versatility for most events.

Hopkinton Buildout ~ Bob DeMattia ~ K1IW

Last year, MMRA needed to vacate from the EMC tower in Southboro.  The board chose to relocate the 449.575 repeater to our Hopkinton location.   MMRA has occupied the Hopkinton site since the 1980's with its 223.94 repeater. The site is at 370 feet, and our antennas will be located at the 160 foot point on the tower.

It has taken sometime to secure permission from the Hopkinton building's owner, but this is now done.

In order to ready the site for the repeater, some tower work is needed.  The board is proposing toadd some additional functionality as well so that we don't need to have additional tower work done later:

(1) Replace existing 30-year-old  223.94 antenna
(2) Install a new triband 2m/222/440 antenna : this will be the main antenna for 440, a backup for '94,  and allow us to install a 2m remote receiver at the site.
(3) Install a PD83 antenna: this will be for a 6m remote receiver
(4) Replace the 30-year old link antenna
(5) Add an additional link antenna for #2 and #3 above.

The 2m component will improve '27 coverage in the Ashland area.  Alternatively, we could install a temporary2m repeater at the site when it is warranted for public service events.

The additional antennas could also be used as a backup site for 449.925 and/or 147.27.

The total cost of equipment, cable, and labor for this proposed operation is $6000.  There will be a membership vote for this expense at our November meeting.

Mike Neilsen, W1MPN, to lead budget process.

Mike, W1MPN, is heading up a process that would be used to develop a budget for the next fiscal year.   He is looking for volunteers to form a committee to develop this budget in time for review and approval at the annual meeting in May.  If you are interested, please contact him at w1mpn@mmra.org or w1mpn@comcast.net

October Business Meeting ~ Bob Evans, Clerk, N1BE

The MMRA board of directors held a business meeting at the headquarters of Stratus Technologies in Maynard on October 21 at 7 PM.  In attendance were K1KWP, K1IW, N1BE, W3EVE, N1BDA, W1MPN, N1DDK, W1BRI, WA1NVC, N1NVK and KG1H.



Kevin, K1KWP gave a treasurer's report covering balances, income and spending.  A review of membership numbers shows that last year had the highest number of members in the last ten years.  Dues are still arriving for the year that began on Sept 1 so we do not have a final count for this year.



Bob, K1IW discussed the Boston Marathon.  The director of the marathon will be organizing and recruiting communicators in the next marathon.  We expect the organizers to decide which repeater assets they want to use and request them from the MMRA public service coordinator.  Bob has given them guidance on what historically been used.



Mike, W1MPN, discussed an outline of the process that could be used to develop a budget for the next fiscal year in time for the annual meeting in May.  Mike also made suggestions for Risk Management to assure the long term viability of the MMRA.  The board informally discussed these suggestions.  Based on the sense of the board, Mike will look for volunteers to form a committee to develop a budget for the annual meeting in May.  The board was interested in Risk Management, but needed more information to consider before taking action.  Mike suggested that he might get someone to provide pro-bono legal advice on this matter at a future business meeting.



Bob, K1IW discussed antenna work at Hopkinton.  This was a refined proposal based upon discussing Hopkinton at a recent business meeting.  This includes antennas, feed lines, a tower climber and miscellaneous items.  The board agreed to an expenditure not to exceed $6000 for this project.  Bob will ask the membership to approve this expenditure at the November meeting.



Bob next discussed the Boxboro convention.  This is now an annual event.  We needed a better antenna or a better location for the talk-in radio.  To address this issue, Bob is seeking access to another location at the hotel.



The meeting adjourned at 8:20 PM.
