President’s Corner ~ David Hornbaker, N1DCH 

Happy Spring!  I hope all your antenna projects are going well and safely!
I would like to encourage everyone to attend the MMRA Annual Membership Meeting and Election.  In addition to voting for new officers and directors, we have two additional items to vote on: 1) Changes to the MMRA Bylaws.  A link to the new by-laws was emailed to all voting members on March 28th (link on page 4).   2) Emergency fund – The emergency fund allows the MMRA Board to approve emergency 
repairs above the normal $500 limit.  These funds can only be used to repair/replace an existing repeater system on an emergency basis.  Apart from last year, we have had this in place since 2018, and was 
implemented because Hub1 died, and a nor’easter cancelled a membership meeting where the vote was scheduled.  Hub1 was off air for a couple of months with the delay in approval and the delay in ordering a new repeater.

After the vote is complete, Kay Savetz – K6KJN will be speaking on the Twenty Things I’ve Learned While Curating the Digital Library of Amateur Radio & Communications.

Please make plans to attend this month’s meeting, We need to ensure that we have a quorum for the elections.  If you cannot make it to New England Sci-Tech, you can join the Zoom meeting: 
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88455380823?pwd=b1MyY0FsVXozWnAxRGZpOVR4Z1RHZz09.  
I look forward to seeing you all at the meeting.

Join us Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM for our weekly Technical Information and Other Stuff (TIaOS) net.  There will be a lively discussion on all sorts of HAM issues, including equipment, antennas, software, 
repeaters, and other stuff.  The main purpose is to test our ability to link up the repeaters in case of an emergency, or to support some event like a marathon.   You can also join via EchoLink if your radio is a little under the weather (or in my case too lazy to walk down to the shack).  See below for more 
information.

You can find out more information about how and when the repeaters are linked on the website 
(https://www.mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html).

Please remember to keep your profile up to date, especially if your email changes.  Note that if your callsign changes, send email to contact@mmra.org and we will update your callsign in the database.

Upcoming MMRA VE sessions:
The May VE Session will be held on Saturday, May 18th at 9:00 AM, at City Church Marlborough 2nd floor, 72 Jefferson Street (across from Kellher Field),  Marlborough, MA https://www.bing.com/maps?q=72%20Jefferson%20Street+marlborough+ma&FORM=HDRSC4

Treasurer’s Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

The MMRA receives donations each year. In the 2023-2024 fiscal year I recorded $1059.27 in donations. In the last 10 years the MMRA has averaged about $1200 in donations each year.  On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank K1YSO who donated since my list in the March newsletter.

As of this writing there are 236 paid memberships for the 2023-2024 year.  At this point four people would still have to renew to reach parity with the 2022-2023 year (which ended on Aug 31, 2023). Sixty-two members have not yet 
renewed and fully expired on Jan 1,2024.

I plan to be at the 
“NE HamXposition” on 
August 22-25. I hope to see you there.

A little Black Box

A little black box of Jewels and Rocks,
with lanterns that flicker and glow,
Make lighter the gloom in my little back room,
where often I hasten to go.
An anthem it peals of whistles and squeals
and of voices so ghostly and queer
That you'd never decry, should you chance to pass by,
what a brotherhood foregathers here! 
Each separate tone has a soul of its own;
each voice is the voice of a friend,
United through space in this gathering-place
at the radiant rainbow's end.
Reverberant sounds ride the wave that rebounds,
like the waves of the sea from afar,
Reporting the doings, the comings and goings of
brothers, wherever thay are.
A curious band, spread over the land,
yet joined from equator to poles,
Disperses the gloom in each little back room
by this magic communion of souls.
I could part with a lot of the things that I've got,
but I'll carry my love to the tomb,
Of that little black box and the joys it unlocks
when I enter that little back room!

~ By Max P. Vander Horck, WA6HUW, QST, November 1966

The MMRA and AI ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW

I asked Google Gemini to write 200 words about the Minuteman Repeater Association in 
iambic pentameter.  Remember Chaucer and Shakespeare from high school?  Here is the result:

The Minuteman's call, a beacon strong and bright,
Unites ham radio voices through the night.
In Stow, Massachusetts, their purpose rings true,
To link and empower, a public service crew.

With repeaters humming, their signal takes its flight,
Extending ranges, voices cutting through the night.
From mountaintop to valley, messages unfurl,
Connecting kin and comrades across the world.

They hold aloft the arts of radio's embrace,
Maintain their stations, a dedicated space.
For public service ever, their network stands,
In times of crisis, helping outstretched hands.

New hams they welcome, fostering radio's art,
A community of voices, playing their part.
So raise a glass, to the Minuteman's might,
Connecting hearts and minds, through day and darkest night.

VE Update ~ Ron Rothman, WO1E

The March MMRA Volunteer Examiner licensing session was held at the Marlborough Fire Station on March 23rd in Marlborough, MA.  Those VE’s in attendance included Steve Babbitt KC1LPZ, Alen Lewis K1ALL, Scott Anderson NE1RD, James Whelan KX1M, Ed Moore Jr. WE1I, Eric Williams KV1J and Ron Rothman WO1E.

The number of candidates being tested was six, which is a good number for a walk-in exam. We had four new 
Technicians and one upgrade to General.  Unfortunately, one candidate did not earn a new license or an upgrade.

The April VE session was held at the Marlborough Fire Station on April 20th  in Marlborough, MA.  Those VE’s in 
attendance included Steve Babbitt KC1LPZ, Alen Lewis K1ALL, Eric Williams KV1J, Dave Hornbaker N1DCH and Ron Rothman WO1E.

The number of candidates being tested was two.  We had one new Technician.  Unfortunately, one candidate did not earn a new license or an upgrade.

Our next VE testing session will be held on May 18th at 9;00 AM at City Church Marlborough 72 Jefferson Street, Second Floor (Shoe Box Building) Marlborough, MA.

Once again, The MMRA VE team will be on hand at the HamXposition on August 24th at the 10:00 AM session.  In addition, I have been appointed to coordinate the exam sessions at the HamXposition.  There will be three testing sessions Saturday at 10:00 AM, 1:00PM and Sunday at 10:00 AM.  If you are a VE and want to help, please contact me on my cell (774) 258-0058 or email rrothman22@gmail.com.  If you are interested in becoming a VE, please contact me as well.  It’s not as hard as you may think to get certified as a Volunteer Examiner.

20 March 2024 Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:29 PM             New England Sci-Tech Center in Natick, MA

Repeater Status Report: 3/20/24 - Bob DeMattia – K1IW 

Marlborugh/Hopkinton 70 cm – 448.225/449.575 – The frequency swap has taken place. Hopkinton is now 448.225 (pl 88.5 linked and pl 71.9 local) and Marlborough DSTAR is now 449.575 MHz (pl 88.5). The Hopkinton repeater will change frequencies again due to conflict with the Mt. Washington repeater, which is on the same frequency and PL.  This will happen after the Boston Marathon.  (Editor: this final change has occurred.)

Quincy: 146.670 –The link radio on the repeater has been fixed. It is operating normally.

Presentation by Scott Andersen, NE1RD, “The 100 Pound DXpedition – The first 20 years.”  

It was the Airlines’ limitation of carrying up to two bags not exceeding 22 kg for each bag (approximately 100 lbs). Scott was very humble, sharing with us the mistakes he made on his travels to the various places, like the Virgin Islands. He carried more than he needed, did not relax enough to enjoy the non-ham activities like scuba diving and often picked a less than optimum location to set up his station. In summary he was teaching us to carry light, i.e. one antenna, concentrate on operating on one band and pick the highest location to operate your station rather than just being close to the water.  Scott posted his daily activities to a blog and he has a website at https://www.bsandersen.com for more information.

17 April 2024 Business Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:30 PM 

Elections: The Ballot Listing for the May 15, 2024, Annual Meeting
President: 		Dave Hornbaker, N1DCH
Vice President: 	John Spencer, WA1MDD 
Secretary:		Ken Horton, KA1GFN
Treasurer: 		Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP
Clerk: 		Stephen Babbitt, KC1LPZ
Directors: 		Robert Evans, N1BE
			James Lee, N1DDK

Emergency Fund: N1DCH made a motion to allocate $4,000, seconded by KC1LPZ and passed unanimously.
 
Bylaws: The Board has approved the changes and must be voted on by the membership.

Treasurer’s Report – Kevin K1KWP

Overall, we are in good shape with a projected $20K in the bank. Currently our expenses are still greater than the revenue, but that gap is narrowing from last year. Visual details provided separately.

HamXposition – Larry – W1DYJ

Larry B made a motion that we spend $350 for the Centerfold Ad spot, seconded by Dave H and passed unanimously.
Prizes: Last year we spent $450 for the 3 prizes. One of the prizes, a Yaesu VX-6R HT was donated back to the MMRA. K1KWP made a motion to allocate $200 for the 2nd and 3rd Place Prizes which was seconded by W1DYJ and passed unanimously.
Room Management regarding when and who will be there was discussed. No decision was finalized tonight.
Call-In Station – A discussion was made on the station location being in a spot where there is more foot traffic. Also the days to operate it was discussed with no final consensus made.

Repeater Status Report - Bob DeMattia – K1IW

New “Modeset” architecture implemented across the network for easier / more reliable network reconfiguration (900MHz Repeaters have not received the update yet).
No major issues with any systems
According to NN1C (BAA ham radio coordinator) the MMRA repeaters performed perfectly for the marathon.
Quincy 2m .67 Repeater Currently working with the City of Quincy for 67’s replacement site.
(Formally) the Belmont Repeater: Currently working with the Town of Belmont for 43’s replacement site. 
Billerica 147.12: Currently awaiting word from a Billerica private property owner for 12’s replacement site.
All other Repeaters: Functioning normally.

Hub 1 Linking – Joe Weisse – W1HAI – was making an inquiry on linking at night all three “NEW ENG” echolink nodes to hub 1. No decision was made at tonight’s meeting.

Echolink: Also noted is Echolink is not working. During the Marathon it was disconnected but restored afterwards. During tonight’s meeting echolink was not working, but Bob has reset it.

Club Activities - Stephen, KC1LPZ 

Support to New or less Active Hams – The purpose of this agenda item is to precisely target the 
concerns and unasked questions that frustrate these folks from being active.
Programming radios is one real concern. K1KWP suggests we have a radio clinic to address that problem. The frequency and format for this clinic was discussed.
Other Elmering activities were mentioned.
Elmering is a “team” effort, not the responsibility falling upon one of us to do coaching. As a team we can provide the right answers to move people forward.
W1DYJ and KC1LPZ are planning to put together a proposal.
Our experiences must be shared to excite and motivate these new members.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (448.225) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
