This is a Hybrid meeting: Marlborough Central Fire Station + ZOOM
Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

Andy Stewart (KB1OIQ) will give a talk about a popular software collection called "Andy's Ham Radio Linux" (AHRL). In its latest version, AHRL has been tested on several flavors of Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS. AHRL is installed on top of whatever Linux you're already running. It provides over 80 ham radio programs which are all Free Software, Open Source Software, or equivalently licensed. Andy will discuss the changes to the most recent version, and will also give a high level overview of the available programs.

Andy has been licensed since 2007, and now holds an Amateur Extra license. Andy is a retired computer engineer, having retired in August 2024.----------

MMRA Elmer(ing) ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

In the November newsletter it was announced that the MMRA will be hosting an Elmering/Mentoring session. The intention is to give new or prospective hams a place to get questions answered, how to use their ham radio license, getting on the air, getting their license, info about local ham resources, and programming their radio. This is purposely being held on zoom so that unlicensed people can participate as well as the multimedia aspect of zoom vs. just a repeater contact.

I have heard members state that they do not think they are qualified to be an Elmer. That is completely wrong. If you have a license and have been on
the air then you are certainly able to mentor other hams. The experience of new hams is just as important as people who have been licensed for decades. For example I bought most of my radios >20 years ago and I am not the
best person to give advice on new equipment.

The first official session was held on Dec 11. There were 14 attendees and the session lasted a good 90 minutes. I want to thank all those who have supported this effort and made themselves available to staff the sessions.

I encourage all members to seriously consider supporting and attending the Elmer Forum. A website with a "flyer" giving info on this is available at mmra.org/elmerforum. The plan is the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 7:30 PM. The next one is Wednesday Jan 8 at 730PM which may happen before this newsletter issue was published.. Additional sessions are February 12, March 12, and April 9. The zoom information is available at mmra.org/elmerforum/elmer_zoominfo.txt

Treasurer's Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

The MMRA receives donations each year. On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank the following members who have donated since my list in the November newsletter: KC1POR and KC1VNA.

So far 236 members have either renewed or recently joined since September 1, 2024 when the new membership year (2024-2025) started. This is the same number as the 2023-2024 year. However as of this writing 60 members who entered grace period on September 1 have not yet renewed and will have expired on January 1. This also means that 60 members are new either paid or free new hams.

We have three repeaters (Quincy, Belmont, Billerica) which we will need to relocate before very long. We will likely have significant costs associated with each these repeater re-locations if/when they actually happen:
- Quincy will likely require new shelter, antennas?, quantum unit of commercial antenna climber
- Belmont likely requires antenna(s), quantum unit of commercial antenna climber
- Billerica quantum unit of commercial antenna climber

I previously forecast that I could easily see this being $10000 of spending. Because the membership approved $3000 spending for Billerica at the November meeting I can now see this being $13000 in spending for the three sites. It may not all happen in the same year but we need to prepare for this.

In addition as of this writing the 146.82 repeater is essentially off the air with a new problem which is not yet completely diagnosed. If this requires antenna system repair that is likely another quantum unit of commercial antenna climber ($3000).

20 November 2024 Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

MMRA Membership Meeting ~ November 20, 2024-Called to order @ 7: 53 PM)

Repeater Status Report: Bob DeMattia, K1IW
 * Quincy 2m .67 Repeater: No further progress to report.
 * (Formally) the Belmont Repeater 145.43: No further progress to report.
 * Billerica 147.12: Awaiting confirmation for a new site.
 * Weston 2m -Visting site on November 26th to hopefully resolve issues with 2m antenna.
 * Burlington: Link radio is not functional.
 * All other Repeaters: Functioning normally.

Vote to Approve Billerica Moving Expenses -- Before a motion was made, the new location is near the water tower with 3 coax cables not in use that are available for the MMRA to use. The site appears clean from the outside.
There are 3 iterations of repeaters along with cabinets, desks and other things that we will need a work party to gather up for disposal. A 6m repeater was taken down at that location. Also, according to Roger, this site has a
generator and electricity is provided without cost to the MMRA. Bob adds that we have used this same climber in the past and must have 2 months' lead time before scheduling his part.

The expense breakdown is as follows:
 * Climber $2,100
 * Second Antenna $ 600
 * U-Haul & Misc Parts $ 300

Dave made a motion to approve up to a $3,000 to move the Billerica Repeater to this new site. Seconded by Larry and the motion passed with a unanimous vote.

MMRA Elmer Forum: Kevin, K1KWP -- Zoom Sessions
The official start for these monthly coaching sessions starts on Wednesday, December 11, 2024 at 7:30 PM and will continue on the 2nd Wednesday of each month thereafter.

We had an unofficial Elmer Forum start on November13th with 2 new Hams participating along with 4-5 of us acting as Elmers. For this practice Elmer Forum session, many questions were asked and answered. We expect these
coaching sessions will grow with more participants.

This is an opportunity to learn about the most suitable equipment to buy without breaking your budget, how to program your radios, where and when you can get on the air and so much more.

Presentation by Dave Hornbaker: N1DCH - Ã¯Â¿Â½Programming Your Radio with CHIRPÃ¯Â¿Â½ DavidÃ¯Â¿Â½s interest in radio began as a youngster when he hung around his Uncle Myron HornbakerÃ¯Â¿Â½s shack Ã¯Â¿Â½ W0GFU (SK) in Fowler, Kansas. In 1975 he earned a First-Class Radiotelephone Operator License (now General Radiotelephone Operator License). At a local telephone company David installed IMTS Telephones in automobiles. Later he worked for Wichita, KS television
station Ã¯Â¿Â½ KAKE-TV as a master control operator. David has worked in the Computer Industry for over 40 years.  He owns and is President of DCH Consulting Services, an Information Technology Company, has a Master of Science, Information Technology Degree from the University of Massachusetts and is President of the MMRA.

CHIRP is free, open-source software for programming many radios from various manufacturers. This software is available on Windows, MacOS and Linux. There are two versions of CHIRP: Next and Legacy. Next is the newest version and Legacy is the older version. To download CHIRP go to https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/ .

Dave described the installation process on the three operating systems. Once installed and the unique cable that connects to a specific radio is in place, the first task is download the contents of what is on the radio to a computer
file. The file received is either a clone file or a live file. The difference between these two types of files is the clone file is a static copy of the contents of the radio that can be edited and uploaded later back to the radio versus a live clone file that can be edited on the fly instantaneously to the radio. One other thing to note on the cable that connects from the computer to the radio is using a high-quality cable that has the 2303 or fai chipset for data transfers. 

Check https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/CableGuide . Reliable sites for locating Repeaters are as follows: https://www.nerepeaters.com/ and https://amateur-radio.net/chirp/ .

18 December 2024 Business Meeting ~ Minutes

MMRA Business Meeting - December 18, 2024-Called to order @ 7: 31 PM 

Repeater Status Report: Bob DeMattia, K1IW
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Belmont: 145.43: Ed, KC1CLA, has has contacted them during the last month and they have not responded.
The plan is to move 145.43 to Burlington.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Billerica 147.12: Bob has been in contact with the Town Manager, currently awaiting an approval.
o If Billerica site becomes available, move 147.12 and 224.88 to the new Billerica site.
o If the Billerica site is not available, the repeater will move 147.12 to Burlington.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Boston 146.82: Power output has dropped Ã¯Â¿Â½ K1BOS is investigating. He has tightened all connections with no
improvement. He will return with a Wattmeter.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Boston 927.0625: The new Boston 900 Repeater has been built by WA1NVC. It is in burn-in testing.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Burlington 224.88: The Burlington (link radio needs repair. (TX no power) Bob will fix it once we figure out the
Billerica situation.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Lowell 442.250: The Lowell link radio needs repair (TX low power). The link still works through North Reading,
so there is no immediate need to make the trip to repair it.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Marlborough 449.925: Hub1 link radio needs repair (TX low power and TX audio needs PL filter). The link radio
is in BobÃ¯Â¿Â½s garage for repairs.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Marlborough 927.700: WA1NVC discussing upgrade.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Marlborough West Ã¯Â¿Â½ While many may not have noticed, the anemometer at Marlborough West is fixed.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Quincy 146.67: With no word Ã¯Â¿Â½ letter or phone call Ã¯Â¿Â½ from the MayorÃ¯Â¿Â½s Office - the current plan looks likely to
move 146.67 to Marlborough East.
Ã¯Â¿Â½ All other Repeaters: Functioning normally.

Allowing Members to Look Up Members: Kevin, K1KWP
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Should members be allowed to look up members on the MMRA Website?
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Should members be able to determine the membership status of another member (Active, Grace, Expired or Non-Member)?

The discussion varied. Roger suggested we keep it simple to name and callsign. Membership status ranged from member to non-member all the way from member to membership in the grace period (September 1st to December 31st) to recently expired membership from January 1st onward to one year or longer. No decision on this subject was made at tonightÃ¯Â¿Â½s meeting other than investigating it further before any formal motion is made.

MMRA Elmer Forum: Kevin, K1KWP
These Elmering sessions are on Zoom to both licensed and unlicensed Hams on the 2nd Wednesday of each month. November 13, 2024, was our initial informal Elmer Meeting Event, which was attended by a few people. On December 11, 2024, our first formal Elmer Session, was attended by 14 people, with one who was not licensed yet. We had several questions asked from recent new Hams. Many questions about licensing and upgrading, several questions on VHF/UHF and even more HF related questions.

One comment Kevin saw in the zoom chat section said, Ã¯Â¿Â½I have learned more about ham radio from the MMRA than from the ARRL.Ã¯Â¿Â½ We had some attendees that found round zero (from November) interesting enough that they came to this December forum and plan to come to the next in January.

Social media: Dave, N1DCH
Ã¯Â¿Â½ We have 915 followers on Facebook
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Should we have regular posts:
     Ã¯Â¿Â½ Announcements
     Ã¯Â¿Â½ Meetings
     Ã¯Â¿Â½ Elmer Forum
     Ã¯Â¿Â½ TIaOS Net
     Ã¯Â¿Â½ VE Sessions
     Ã¯Â¿Â½ Other events, e.g. Ham Exposition, Algonquin Flea Market
Ã¯Â¿Â½ Should we add other Social Media? Return to X (Twitter) other Social Media Sites?

TonightÃ¯Â¿Â½s discussion includes putting some of our presentations on YouTube to draw attention to the MMRA and Amateur Radio. Other social media sites where younger people are active received discussion. Updating our events was discussed with K8ZBE offering to assist in some of the updating.

Algonquin Flea: Saturday, February 15, 2025

Billerica Antenna Repaired
Thanks to the efforts of
   Bruce KC1US
   John W1NI
   Kevin KB1KTR
   Kevin K1KWP
   Kimberly KB1KYS
   Mike W1USN
The Billerica antenna is now vertical again. The old and unused 6m antenna was also taken down. Getting people to help on a workday can be a challenge, so many thanks to these volunteers for taking time out of their day to help out!

73, Bob, K1IW

Boston 900 MHz Quantar

Here [included photo] is the Boston 900 MHz Quantar. It has been completely aligned, programmed, tested on the test pair, and will be burned in for a week or two. You will notice a red circle. I have added a V.24 interface board and 
cover plate with cutouts for the jacks. This will allow us to do P25 networking, if we want to, at some time in the future.

https://www.mmra.org/MMRACOPolicy-March2019.pdf

The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur Radio and public service.  The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters in Eastern Massachusetts.

The MMRA meets each month from September to June.  Meeting times, locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this newsletter and on weekly nets.  Meetings are open to all interested parties.  Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in September, November, January, March, and May.  The intervening meetings are also open to all members and are for

MMRA QRM Policy

MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage with that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (448.225) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
