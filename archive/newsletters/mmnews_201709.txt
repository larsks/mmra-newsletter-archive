MMRA Work Parties at Quincy and North Reading

Bob DeMattia ~ K1IW

Since last May, MMRA held two work parties - one in Quincy and the other in North Reading.  In Quincy, we repaired the damaged entryway door and installed the cellular-radio based internet connection.  In North Reading, we reinstalled the 2m antenna a bit higher, shored up the UHF link antenna, and also installed the cellular-radio based internet connections.  We also replaced the failed link radio and upgraded the controller to an SCOM 7330

Helping out in Quincy were Bryan Cerqua W1BRI, John Spencer WA1MDD, Clark Conti N1NVK, and James Lee N1DDK.  (Sorry, no photos for Quincy).

WA1MDD, N1UEC, KB1MBG, W0ZIO, KC1US, and K1IW met at the North Reading repeater site to finish some long-needed tasks:

	* N1UEC & W0ZIO went up the tower and remounted the VHF antenna and UHF link antenna.  The VHF antenna now sits above the cat walk railing.  The link antenna is now properly transitioned from a small mast to a larger one.

	* On the ground, KB1MBG assisted the climbers, while the rest of us worked on installing the new 7330 controller, Raspberry Pi/Internet hookup, and repair of the link radio.

	* All of this was completed except for the link radio, which was beyond repair.  Despite our best efforts, it was still 5KHz off frequency.  The radio was subsequently replaced on a later visit to the site.

The Amateur's Code

The Radio Amateur is:
CONSIDERATE...never knowingly operates in such a way as to lessen the pleasure of others.
LOYAL...offers loyalty, encouragement and support to other amateurs, local clubs, and the American Radio Relay League, through which Amateur Radio in the United States is represented nationally and  internationally.
PROGRESSIVE...with knowledge abreast of science, a well-built and efficient station and operation above reproach.
FRIENDLY...slow and patient operating when requested; friendly advice and counsel to the beginner; kindly assistance, cooperation and consideration for the interests of others. These are the hallmarks of the amateur spirit.
BALANCED...radio is an avocation, never interfering with duties owed to family, job, school or community.
PATRIOTIC...station and skill always ready for service to country and community.

Paul M. Segal, W9EEA, 1928

Early Ham History – Part 1


>From W1DYJ: I recently obtained an ARRL Handbook from 1962, the year I was first licensed. The first few pages are a wonderful, short history of the early years of Ham radio. I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I did. It is in 5 parts.
Here is Part 1: 1900 through WW1

Amateur radio is a scientific hobby, a means of gaining personal skill in the fascinating art of electronics and an opportunity to communicate with fellow citizens by private short-wave radio. Scattered over the globe are over 250,000 amateur radio operators who perform a service defined in international law as one of "self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried on by . . . duly authorized persons interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest."

>From a humble beginning at the turn of the century, amateur radio has grown to become an established institution. Today the American followers of amateur radio number over 200,000, trained communicators from whose ranks will come the professional communications specialists and executives of tomorrow—just as many of today's radio leaders were first attracted to radio by their early interest in amateur radio communication. A powerful and prosperous organization now provides a bond between amateurs and protects their interests; an internationally respected magazine is published solely for their benefit. The military services seek the cooperation of the amateur in developing communications reserves. Amateur radio supports a manufacturing industry which, by the very demands of amateurs for the latest and best equipment, is always up-to-date in its designs and production techniques—in itself a national asset. Amateurs have won the gratitude of the nation for their heroic performances in times of natural disaster; traditional amateur skills in emergency communication are also the stand-by system for the nation's civil defense. Amateur radio is, indeed, a magnificently useful institution.

Although as old as the art of radio itself, amateur radio did not always enjoy such prestige. Its first enthusiasts were private citizens of an experimental turn of mind whose imaginations went wild when Marconi first proved that messages actually could be sent by wireless. They set about learning enough about the new scientific marvel to build homemade spark transmitters. By 1912 there were numerous Government and commercial stations, and hundreds of amateurs; regulation was needed, so laws, licenses and wavelength specifications appeared. There was then no amateur organization nor spokesman. The official viewpoint toward amateurs was something like this:

	"Amateurs ? . . . Oh, yes. . . . Well, stick 'em on 200 meters and below; they'll never get out of their backyards with that."

But as the years rolled on, amateurs found out how, and DX (distance) jumped from local to 500-mile and even occasional 1000-mile two-way contacts. Because all long-distance messages had to be relayed, relaying developed into a fine art— an ability that was to prove invaluable when the Government suddenly called hundreds of skilled amateurs into war service in 1917. Meanwhile U.S. amateurs began to wonder if there were amateurs in other countries across the seas and if, some day, we might not span the Atlantic on 200 meters.

The above is COPYRIGHT 1962 by ARRL.  The Handbook back then cost $3.50.
