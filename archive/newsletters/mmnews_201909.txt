Membership Meeting 
Wednesday, 18 September 7:30 PM
Two Ideas for Skyhooks
Larry Banks, W1DYJ
After purchasing a second home on the coast of Maine, Larry had to build a new ham station from scratch. This talk 
describes the concept, design, and 
implementation of an 18’ rotatable mast for a 6m Yagi, and a 34’ mast for HF 
dipoles. 

This is NOT a “how to” talk. It is an “ideas” talk and has some practical ideas for construction that you may be able to use yourself.

Location 

New England Sci-Tech Inc.
16 Tech Circle	Natick MA
Talk-in: 147.27  pl 146.2

MMRA Control Operators Responsibilities
https://www.mmra.org/MMRACOPolicy-March2019.pdf
-----------

The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur Radio and public 
service.  The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters in Eastern Massachusetts.

The MMRA meets each month from September to June.  Meeting times, locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this newsletter and on weekly nets.  Meetings are open to all interested parties.  Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in 
September, November, January, March, and May.  The intervening meetings are also open to all members and are for general business.

The Minuteman newsletter is emailed one week before each general interest meeting.  Members are encouraged to submit articles: send to the editor at newsletter@mmra.org.  The deadline for articles is the last Friday of the month preceding the meeting.

Each Tuesday evening at 8PM the MMRA links most of the repeaters for an open net.  The topic is “Technical Information and Other Stuff”.   Join us!

Membership in the MMRA is open to all radio amateurs.  Annual dues are $25 per individual or $35 per family.  See our website for details. Contact information is listed on the top of the last page of this newsletter.

No part of this newsletter can be copied or posted elsewhere without prior approval from the club. 

MMRA QRM Policy
MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.

President’s Corner ~ David Hornbaker , N1DCH 

It has been a busy summer!  New antennas have been installed for Marlborough 223.940, 448.225, APRS and the remote 6-meter receiver.  The shelters at both MRE and MRW were painted and MRE got a new mast, thanks to all who participated on the work parties.  There was some lightning damage to the router and DSL equipment at MRW, which resulted in internet loss for about a week.  Special thanks to Bob, K1IW for his hard work with our DSL vendors to get things back up.  The surge came in via the DSL line but no repeaters or antennas were damaged.

This should be a reminder to all of us to make sure our stations are properly ground and to consider disconnecting antennas when not in use.

I look forward to seeing everyone at HamXpostion.  Drop by our room and say hi!  We will be holding a raffle, details on prizes and entry are on mmra.org.  Raffle drawing will be on Sunday at the MMRA session.  MMRA will also be hosting a table at the Friday and Saturday evening dinners.  Tickets are $35 per person (discounted) and can be ordered at mmra.org/renew.html.  Raffle tickets may also be purchased at mmra.org/renew.html

All memberships expire in August!  You can renew membership online using PayPal at mmra.org/renew.html, or send a check to Minuteman Repeater Association, PO Box 669, Stow, MA 01775-0669, or in person at HamXpostion (cash and check only).  If you renew for 2 years (expiration in 2021), you will get 1 entry to the MMRA raffle.
