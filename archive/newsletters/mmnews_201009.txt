Membership Meeting ~ Wednesday, 15 September 2010 @ 7:30 PM
Antenna Myths: Transmission Line Tall Tales 
Dave Allred ~ N1VU
Lexington Public Library ~ 1874 Mass Avenue
Talk in — 146.79

Whatever you choose, open wire, hardline, or wet string, myths can suck up your signal as it travels between rig and antenna. David Allred, N1VU, details where your RF really goes, both useful and useless. We will examine transmission line tricks, traps, and tips that will help you persuade your RF to be obedient and useful. Myths from print, 
75 meters, and the Internet will be exposed and expunged.

David Allred, N1VU, has been seen coaxing RF through coax to and from antennas for quite some time, both professionally (FCC Radiotelephone 1970) and avocationally (WB1EOQ 1977). He is a member of the Harvard Wireless Club, the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society, and the IEEE Computer Society.

As a consultant at Photon, Inc. in Cambridge, David uses his UNIX and Macintosh computer expertise to help client businesses do more with less while saving time and money. He is active, mostly on HF SSB and CW, on those occasions when antenna construction and experimenting is interrupted by operating.

"Get thee to the sun, we have time."  Those were the very words of our newsletter editor in a email to me earlier today.  While I was under a deadline to get my bimonthly column to him, it was just really too nice a day to be inside typing on a computer.

Now that the sun has set, I have returned to the computer and Larry's words have taken this column on a whole new track.

Like many other club members, my work-related, friends and family activities often compete with club activities.  In the MMRA, there are always things to be done.  We are fortunate to have over 200 members to help share the load.

Our biggest need is for technical projects.  There are things to fix and improve on our twenty repeaters.  We have a new shelter for Sligo Hill, donated by N1KMA, which needs to be gutted, cleaned, painted and assembled.

In addition to numerous technical projects, there are other ways you can participate.  You can help by being a net control station for our weekly net.  Or perhaps watch our club table at the Marlboro flea market or the Boxboro convention.  For those who are more or less confined to home, write a short article for our club newsletter.  There are many ways you can participate.  If you are interested, drop us an eMail at contact@mmra.org.

Help Needed!

Last fall, the MMRA transported a military shelter
donated by N1KMA to a storage facility in Marlborough. Now we are looking for members (or even non-members) that are interested in getting this shelter
reconditioned and ready for service to the club.  The long term plan is to replace the existing Sligo shelter which is over 30 years old and falling apart.
The new shelter needs to be stripped and repainted.  The existing rack and internal components need to be taken out and new racks & cabling installed.  If you are interested in helping, send email to contact@mmra.org.

Treasurer's Report ~ Kevin Paetzold (K1KWP)

This is the first newsletter since the end of the MMRA fiscal year (May 31.)  Certainly this year will go down as one of the most active and unique in the MMRA's 30+ year history.

More than $9000 was spent on expanding and improving the system.  This includes lightning protection, grounding, and power improvements at multiple sites, and new repeater sites in Boston.  This is more than four times the average spending on the system of the previous five years.  Some of the projects included:

Purchase of the new Marlboro West (MRW) 900 repeater
Purchase of a 7K controller for our new 10m repeater
Tower work and antennas projects for MRW (summer 2009)
Tree trimming and antenna projects at Marlboro East (MRE) (spring 2010)
Cleanup/rebuild of the 146.820 repeater including a new power supply
Conversion of our 6m repeater from a tube amp to a solid state amp
Repair of the Hopkington (HOP) repeater and improvments to grounding and lightning protection at the site
Repair of the Quincy (QCY) repeater and improvments to grounding and lightning protection at site
Improvments to grounding and lightning protection at the MRW site
Addition of the new Boston 900 repeater
Move of DSTAR repeater from MRE to Boston
Purchase of two SCOM 7330 repeater controllers to upgrade HUB1 and 2

Likewise, income during the year was also four times the average of the previous five years.  This large one time increase in income was primarily due to the donation and sale of the Larcan transmitter amps and the salvaged copper waveguide.  Special thanks goes to those responsible for making this happen and those who donated their time to make this happen.

There have been some changes to the fixed cost structure of the MMRA.  My articles in the September newsletters of previous years go into details of those costs.  Changes this year include eliminating any fees associated with the checking account, and switching the phone line at MRW from a Verizon voice line to a Galaxy DSL line.  Newsletter costs have dropped dramatically as the club has pushed eMail newsletters.  Power usage at MRW has increased more than 30% since August/September of 2009 when the 900 repeater went online.

The net result of the spending, income, and expenses described above is that the financial reserves of the MMRA increased by 104% year over year.  Since June 1, 2004 the reserve has increased 303%.  Of course it still would only take one significant lightning hit to use up most of the reserve....

As I write this article the Boxborough convention has just occured.  About one third of the membership visited the MMRA booth based on renewal counts.  I would also like to welcome nine new members who joined at Boxboro (W1BP, KB1TTF, K1NZQ, KB1UKU, KB1JFG, N1HVA, N1DDK, N1TQ, and KB1EDA) to the MMRA.

FCC: New Rules for Employee Participation in Drills Begin September 3 


Beginning September 3, the new, revised wording of Section 97.113 goes into effect. As of this date, the FCC will permit government entities that sponsor disaster and emergency drills to hold these drills without applying for a waiver. Additionally, employees who wish to participate in non-government-sponsored drills and exercises may do so under certain conditions. Part 97 is the portion of the Commission's rules that govern the Amateur Radio Service. Read more at:

Don’t Forget!
Every Tuesday @ 8 PM
Technical, Informational and Other Stuff Net


The MMRA’s repeaters are linked Tuesday nights for the TIAOS Net.  Join us!  This is a good way to keep up with what is happening in the MMRA and ask your ham related questions.  

We need another net control!  Over the past few months there have been some weeks when the Net was not activated as we only have three and need four. 

If you would like to try your hand at Net Control contact me at W1DYJ@mmra.org  – we have a script you can use to start with.  This is good practice for a number of ham related operations, from emergency preparedness to contesting.

Current Net Control Operators:
Week 1	WA1JIM		Jimmy Devaire	
Week 2	???		shared	
Week 3	W1DYJ		Larry Banks
Week 4	K1KWP		Kevin Paetzold	
Week 5 	W1DYJ		Larry Banks

To connect using the digital modes during the Net, use the New England Reflector:
	For IRLP use node 9127
	For Echolink, connect via *NEW-ENG*.  You can find this under “Node Types” >> “Conferences”

NOTE — the Echolink conference 
Connection has recently changed to *NEW-ENG*.
