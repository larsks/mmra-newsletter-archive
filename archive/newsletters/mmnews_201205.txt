About the Minuteman Repeater Association

The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur Radio and public service.  The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters in Eastern
Massachusetts.

The MMRA meets (usually) on the 3rd Wednesday of each month from September to June.  Meeting times, locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this newsletter and on weekly nets.  Meetings are open to all interested parties.  Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in September, November, January, March, and May.  The intervening meetings are also open to all members and are for general business.

The Minuteman newsletter is Emailed one week before each general interest meeting.  Members are encouraged to submit articles which can be sent to the editor at newsletter@mmra.org.  The deadline for articles is the last Friday of the month preceding the meeting.

Each Tuesday evening at 8PM the MMRA links most of the repeaters for an open net.  The topic is “Technical Information and Other Stuff”.   Join us!

Membership in the MMRA is open to all radio amateurs.  Annual dues are $25 per individual or $35 per family.  See our website for details.

Email to the club leadership should be sent to 
contact@mmra.org. The MMRA maintains a web site at:  http://www.mmra.org/

An email distribution list for club members named “MMRA” is at: www.yahoogroups.com/

No part of this newsletter can be copied or posted elsewhere without prior approval from the club. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

MMRA QRM Policy

MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to report repeater 
activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at contact@mmra.org or via other means.

The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage that individual on the air.  Please include the time and date of any incident.  Measures are being taken to make audio recordings of repeater activity.

President’s Corner — Current Events

Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

A number of items are on our current agenda:

Sligo Update

Renovation work by the City of Marlborough at our Sligo Hill repeater site continues.  In the next stage, all antennas on the water tank need to be removed.  The APRS, 6m receiver, 224.880, 449.925 and 927.7 antennas will be removed first, with 147.27 shortly thereafter.  During the time these antennas are down, we will have most systems running on mast-mounted backup antennas.  These antennas are about 100 feet lower, so you can expect reduced coverage.  The city has not given us a time table for when things will return to normal, so things may stay this way for quite some time.

Boxboro 2012

The Boxboro Convention is on August 24th, 25th, and 26th.  MMRA will be providing talk-in from our hospitality suite just off the main courtyard inside the hotel throughout the convention.  Be sure to stop by and say hello to the other members of the club.

Even better, we are planning to attend the Saturday evening banquet as a club.  The banquet features a guest speaker and other entertainment. If you would like to join us, purchase your banquet ticket through us to receive a $5 discount.  Contact K1IW at k1iw@mmra.org for further information.

March Membership Meeting

Ham's in Emergency Communications
Mike Neilsen, W1MPN

Mike discussed how ham radio operators are still considered important players in the overall emergency communication (EMCOMM) response.  He outlined how ham radio is used in today’s complex public safety environment in the face of complicated issues of reduced state budgets and agency consolidations.  He also briefly described the requirements of NIMS, ICS, and state programs, as they apply to ham operators.  W1MPN explained many of the new approaches to the integration of ham EMCOMM volunteers into initiatives such as COML, RADO, ACS, and COOP/COG, and how they relate to RACES, ARES, SKYWARN, MARS, and the CERT programs.  He then gave a brief update of the changes being proposed for the existing RACES program by MEMA, as part of the current outreach to hams.

>From the ARRL Eastern Massachusetts Section News

Amateur radio volunteers turned out in droves for the 2012 Boston Marathon on April 16. According to Amateur Radio Communications Coordinator Steve Schwarm, W3EVE, approximately 250 hams provided communications support to the Boston Athletic Association, Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, American Red Cross, Boston Emergency Medical Services, along with the public safety departments of eight different municipalities. 

Forty hams comprised the start team; 110 were situated along the course; 20 were assigned to Net Control in Brookline; 60 amateurs made up the finish team; an additional 22 helped coordinate bus operations.

Amateurs were also stationed at the ARES Regional Command Center in Bridgewater, and at the MA State EOC in Framingham. 

The Boston Marathon continues to be one of the largest and most visible Amateur Radio public service operations in the country. The amateur community can be proud of its contributions to this historic race.

Boxboro — Call for Speakers

Ken Caruso, WO1N

All speakers wanting to participate in the 2012 ARRL New England Division Convention program, please contact us at your earliest opportunity and include a subject title and a brief abstract.

The dates for the convention are August 24 – 26, 2012.

If you represent a regional club or organization (e.g. NESMC, CEMARC, MARS, NEWS etc.) we can help facilitate open forums or closed meetings. We do ask organizations to please consider Sunday morning time slots for their closed meetings.

Groups looking to set up information booths should get your request in early. While the information booths are offered without charge, we ask for some volunteer time in return to assist us with ticket sales and other logistics during the convention operation.

Proposed Change to MMRA ByLaws
Bob DeMattia, President  — K1IW 

The current bylaws require a vote for the general membership for any expenditure over $500.  This makes sense most of the time, but there are times when things must be done, such as repairs where there isn't really must choice, and often time is of the essence.

This bylaw will eliminate the general membership requirement under certain conditions.

This is what we have now:

a.   All expenditures in excess of five hundred dollars must be approved by the majority of the membership present at a meeting. The subject of the vote must be  announced to the members in the meeting announcement.  Alternatively, such a vote may be accomplished by mail or by electronic means as provided in Article IV section 8 and Article IV section 9.  If this alternate method is used, a majority of the full membership is required.

The proposal is to add the following to this paragraph:

Expenses related to the immediate repair of existing equipment or to prevent damage to existing equipment are exempt from this limit and may be authorized by the board.  In this case, the board shall provide notice to the general membership of such expense at the next regularly scheduled general meeting.

This will be voted on at the June membership meeting.
