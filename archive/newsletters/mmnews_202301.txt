The “new” FCC RF Exposure Rules— Larry Banks, W1DYJ

This is a Hybrid meeting: New England SciTech + ZOOM
Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

The FCC recently changed the rules about RF Exposure for all of us.
The exposure criterion have not changed, but the rules about assessing our
station's exposure have. Larry recently assessed his station to meet these
new rules. It was easier than he expected, and he learned a few things along
the way. This may be a model that will help you evaluate your station.

Larry was licensed in 1962 as novice KN1VFX and became W1DYJ in 1966. From 1969 to 1985 he was an engineer and project manager for Hewlett-Packard Medical in Waltham and Andover MA, first developing electrocardiographs and then having the fortune to be involved with developing the first commercially successful cardiac ultrasound system. He then assumed responsibility for establishing both the cardiac R&D lab’s Computer Aided Design environment and the SW Testing and Quality group, along with ongoing responsibility for the Printed Circuit Layout group, the technical library, ongoing technical education, and ISO9001 as the R&D Section Manager for “R&D Process Improvement.” (This was the heyday for Total Quality Control, and applying ISO9000 to an R&D lab was quite an education… Worse than herding cats!)

He moved to HP Medical Education in 1993 to be responsible for technical and project management training. When Agilent split out of HP in 1999, he became Agilent Technology’s global program manager for their Learning Management System. He “retired” in 2005 and then consulted for Avago Technologies (now Broadcom) on eLearning technologies through 2012.

Larry holds three degrees in EE from MIT. He spends his time chasing DX and contesting in Woburn, traveling with his wife Maren (pre-Covid and hopefully again,) and attending as many jazz and classical concerts as they can. He is also the net manager and newsletter editor for the
MMRA, publications editor for HamXposition, a member of the YCCC, and continues as a member of the Merrymeeting ARA in mid-coast (Brunswick) ME, where he and Maren had a 2nd home from 2008-2021.

16 November 2022 Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:33 PM

With a short meeting agenda, it was decided to put John Portune’ s anticipated Presentation at the beginning of tonight's meeting. His presentation will follow later in these Minutes.

Repeater Status Report – from Bob DeMattia – K1IW –  

* Prudential Antenna - The new mast and antenna are still in his garage awaiting the Pru. Bob is eager to get this out of his garage and to the site. We are also  looking forward to the improved signal in Boston and the surrounding outlying areas.

* 10 Meter Weston Receiver: - When this is working the signal is very good, but the intermittent
functioning still remains making the 10 meter option inconsistent. 

* 2 Meter Weston Repeater - Bob will be working on the 2m Kenwood and amplifier by the end of the month, and it should be installed by the end of the year. 

* North Reading: When DR2X malfunctions, a reset is required.. Bob installed a Kasa Smartswitch so he can reset it remotely.

* All other MMRA Repeater systems normal – Last Saturday, November 12th ARES had a practice
emergency drill from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The MMRA Repeaters involved worked well. 

VE Exam Session: Saturday, November 19th at 9:00 AM at the City Church Marlborough, 72 Jefferson Street, 2nd Floor (the Shoebox Building, next to Kelleher Field), Marlborough MA. Contact Ron (WO1E@mmra.org) for more information. 

Please tell your friends, who are interested in taking tests, that they must have photo IDs and FRNs

Copy of license required if upgrading (or Proof from the ARRL, or QRZ website)
               Note: Social Security numbers are no longer accepted by the FCC Everyone must have an FRN

Other Business: - A brief discussion on alternative upcoming meeting places mentioned a few places beyond the NE Science Tech Center and the main Fire Station Training Room in Marlborough. This is exploratory and any
member is welcome to make additional suggestions. For example, the Stow Auditorium was mentioned. Any
potential meeting place must have internet access as all meetings will be hybrid.

One other suggestion made is to hold our Board Meetings only on Zoom. No decision on that was made tonight.

Feature Presentation – Build a 10M Moxon Antenna – John Portune – W6NBC briefly stated the Moxon Antenna is a 2 element Yagi with the ends folded inward. The design is similar to a hex beam. It is a closed-spaced wire Yagi. It starts with the Reflector then the Director. Many articles have been published on this topic. See ARRL “On The Air” March, 2022 magazine page 11 & “On The Air” March, 2021 page 13. John also has an extensive list of other articles published August, 2022 QST, page 30; November, 2022 QST Pages 20 & 32 and 46 additional QST Articles. “Ten-meter Moxons are typically about 12 feet wide and weigh less than 10 pounds.” On The Air”  March, 2022, p 11.

For those General and above class operators, John presented how to make the Moxon Antenna into a multiband. He also presented the Moxon Calculator which can be found on http://www.tippete.net/cgi-bin/moxgen.pl .

Repeater Update ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW

Happy 2023 to all!   We are locked and loaded for the Prudential Center move, but have not heard back from the building management.  When they are ready, so are we!   The Weston repeater upgrade is also delayed.  Due to unforeseen issues during set up, the amplifier needs to be sent back to Henry Radio for repairs.  This will probably delay installation until at least February, perhaps longer.  The new Billerica repeater seems to be operating great.  One note however: The TX output tone has been changed to 162.2 to avoid interference issues.  The input tone remains the MMRA standard 146.2.
----------

Annual TIaOS Net Report ~ Larry Banks, W1DYJ

We continue to see weekly participation averaging around 20.  The largest participation during 2022 was on 26 April, with 31 check-ins. I want to thank Tom, KB1OQA; Ed, KC1CLA; Kevin, K1KWP; and Jonathan, K1BTZ for being net controls during this past year.  We all hope to hear you Tuesday nights at 8 pm.  

And we would be HAPPY to have you (any of you…) volunteer to be a Back-Up NC!!!    We have a script you can use..  All of our current NCs would welcome you to the “club.”

20 December Business Meeting ~ Minutes

Repeater Status Report – from Bob DeMattia – K1IW –  
* Prudential Antenna – On the relocation we last heard from them in early November that it would happen in November. However, we have not heard anything yet. All items are ready to go when we get the call.
* Billerica – Antenna replacement is completed. The link audio was low. That issue has been fixed, thanks to John – W1NI.  Kevin – K1KWP -added that the antenna seems to have less gain.     
* Weston – The new 2m Kenwood & amplifier are here and Bob will be working on it during Christmas Break.
* North Reading: The Kasa Smartswitch allows Bob to reset it remotely, but a more permanent solution will be installed in the Spring. The PL tone issue remains. Bob, K1IW, suggested that this is the next 2m repeater to upgrade. Also, we need to do a thorough cleaning at the site (cobwebs, dust, mice excrement). 
* 10 Meter Weston Receiver: -Still inconsistently works.  Larry – W1DYJ -mentioned the link audio has problems. When working the signal is very good, but the intermittent functioning makes the 10 meters option not very useful.
* Mendon – Persistent login attempts detected from numerous IP addresses. This is occurring on Billerica and Burlington to a lesser degree. While not much of a security problem, excess bandwidth is consumed to the tune of 18-30 MB/day. Port forwarding turned off. Access is now through the main server. 
* Hopkinton – An incident report from John Iwuc – KB1VXY – who is President of the Framingham Amateur Radio Association that the repeater was displaying bursts of static when accessing our Tuesday evening Net. But his last net access the repeater was functioning normally. No further action will take place other than this mention in these Minutes. 

All other MMRA Repeater systems normal – 

TIaOS Net – Larry, W1DYJ, reported that the NH folks start their Tuesday night traffic net right at 9:00 PM, sometimes before the TIaOS net has finished. Bob, K1IW, will talk to Bernie (our contact at NH ) to resolve this sometime issue

Algonquin Amateur Radio Club Flea Market: This annual event is taking place on Saturday February 18, 2023 at the Whitcomb Middle School in Marlborough from 9 AM to Noon. A motion was made by Larry – W1DYJ – to spend up to $30 for two tables for this event. Seconded by Bob – N1BE – with the motion passing unanimously. 

Bob -K1IW: Ken – KA1GFN & Kevin – K1KWP discussed the locations available for our Tables with payment arrangements from Kevin. Bob will do some of the table coverage and asks that other members assist with table coverage too. 

Dave – N1DCH will arrange to have approximately 50 brochures printed up that will include the Billerica site. He and Larry will do the final edit should any additional updates be needed. 

VE Exam Session: Saturday, February 18th at 9:00 AM at this AARC Flea Market Event. Dave – N1DCH – and Steve – KC1LPZ - are members of the VE team. We ask, please, that Test Candidates obtain an FRN as SS# are no longer used by the FCC. Also needed will be a photo id and a copy of your license, if you are planning to upgrade. Contact Ron (WO1E@mmra.org) for more information.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), and Hopkinton (449.575).  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially
important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
