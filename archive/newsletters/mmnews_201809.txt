Membership Meeting Wednesday, 19 September 7:00 PM
Host: Bob Phinney
Discovering Ham Radio through Makerspace
The traditional path into ham radio is an electronics or radio interest that leads to a license, and then talking on the radio.

NESCITECH is a new maker space venture started by Bob Phinney and has a different approach.  They offer a variety of maker programs for kids and families.  Their programs including building electronics, woodworking, metalworking, and a variety of other media.  They then use or play with what they built, which leads to another more advanced project.  The programs show how ham radio can be used to use, play with, and perhaps show off what they have built.
Several presenters will discuss this new approach.  There will also be a tour of the facilities.
MMRA members (and non members alike) are encouraged to bring themselves, friends, kids, or grandkids as this is an environment which is of interest to all.

President’s Corner

David Wolfe ~ KG1H

It is evident from the lack of activity on our repeaters that hams are not interested in having conversations by voice with other hams, or if they do respond to a call they have little to say.  The repeaters are our 'bread and butter.' This disturbs me, as several years ago the MMRA and other repeaters were a main conversational medium and a source of interesting discussions.
What has changed in ham radio?  Is it the ages of the new hams who have radically different interests and/or the ages and interests of the older hams have dissuaded the new hams?  What attracted the new/young hams in the first place to amateur radio?  Maybe we should ask them.
It brings up the point, what can WE do to entice our 'old' hams to join in on discussions and  attract the new comers to participate?  Possibly publicize subjects-of-interest sessions that are hot topics of the month. We would need experts to lead the sessions and notices sent out announcing the events.
Looking for suggestions to revitalize our repeater activities, and good reason to continue upgrading our repeaters.

Treasurer’s Report

Kevin Paetzold ~ K1KWP

I would like to thank John (W1JMC) for many years (a decade plus) of service to the club as the elected secretary of the club.   Because the treasurer currently services the PO box and because the secretary is in charge of memberships the treasurer and the secretary are often interfacing.   I would like to thank Dave (N1DCH) for agreeing to serve as secretary.  The clerk position for the club has been open for two years.  I would like to see someone step forward to fill this position.
A new MMRA fiscal year started on June 1.  This is now fiscal year 2018-2019.  The membership year (dues) ends on August 31.

MMRA income exceeded expenses in the previous fiscal year.  One significant financial event is that K1IW was able to sell all of the remaining LARCAN material which the club invested in the 2016-2017 fiscal year.  A summary of the income and expense for the last 8 years is on the next page.

[Chart: Income and Spending per membership year]

The chart (below) shows the funds balance delta for the last 8 years.  Because the electric bills are paid ahead and because most people have not renewed yet this new fiscal year shows a slight deficit.  With the information available to me at this time I expect income to exceed expense this year (unless the board spends more than I know of at this time).

[Chart: Actual Balance Deltas]

Income sources and spending areas are detailed below:

[Chart: income Spurces 2017-2018]
[Chart: Spending 2017-2018]

Last year (2017-2018) the MMRA had 208 paid memberships.  This is a decrease from the all time high (in my time frame) of 230 set in 2016-2017.

[Chart: paid Membership Numbers]

The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year.  Most of this is in direct $ contributions.  Some donations are of equipment which the club either uses or sells.  Donation summary for the last 10 years is below.  IMHO the club does not acknowledge those who donate enough.  On behalf of the club I would like to thank people below who donated.  Hopefully I did not leave anyone off (and if I did I am sorry):

Detailed financial information is presented at almost every business meeting.  These meetings generally occur in the months which do not have general membership meetings.  They are announced on the www.mmra.org website.  All members are invited and encouraged to attend these meetings.  Of course much more than the finances are discussed at these meetings including repeater status, repeater decisions, planning, etc….		73,  K1KWP

New Center for STEM Education and Amateur Radio

Bob Phinney ~ K5TEC

New England Amateur Radio (NEAR) has a new home in Natick at New England Sci-Tech Inc., a 
non-profit STEM education center and maker space.  NEAR will also host a new startup ham radio club for youth and families called STARS - Sci-Tech Amateur Radio Society. STARS will replace the Clay Center Amateur Radio Club in Brookline (CC-ARC), which was one of the largest youth and family oriented clubs in New England with over 350 members, of which over a hundred are (or were) youth. NEAR had 
supported CC-ARC and other clubs with equipment, radio classes, and VE sessions. CC-ARC has now disbanded and members are encouraged to join STARS and NEAR instead. Both clubs have space in New England Sci-Tech (NESciTech), located near the Wellesley-Natick line near Rt 30. NE Sci-Tech offers classes in amateur radio, electronics, astronomy, and many other STEM topics for adults, families with children, and high school youth. 

High on a hill with 5 acres and ample parking, perfect for doing amateur radio and public astronomy nights, the facility contains several classrooms, woodworking shop, machine room, maker space, meeting spaces, kitchenette, and storage. NESciTech will be directed by amateur radio operators Bob Phinney K5TEC, Ted Reimann KB1NTJ, and Norman Wittels KC1JLB. They encourage you to check out the facility and programs on line at www.nescitech.org, at one of the upcoming open houses, or email Bob Phinney to schedule a visit: bobphinney@nescitech.org.
