Membership Meeting ~ Wednesday, 21 September 2022 ~7:30—9:30 pm
Digital Modes Beyond FT8 ~ Leandra MacLennan ~ AF1R

This is a Hybrid meeting: New England SciTech + ZOOM

Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

Do all your conversations on HF consist of exchanging grid squares and two-digit numbers such as 
-08, -16, -06, or +03?   Have you ever wished you could have a real conversation with the ham in 
southern France who just sent you a -15?

Yes, it’s a thrill to work that new country on FT8. But all they sent you was a grid square and “-18”. Technically you’ve now worked that country, but are you really satisfied with your “QSO”? Have you ever wanted to know more about the person at the other end of your FT8 contact? Maybe the operator is an XYL. What is his or her name? What is he/she using as an antenna? What’s his/her life story?

FT8 is great for quick contacts, but there is no opportunity to find out more about the operator at the other end of the QSO.  There are many other digital modes where you can have a real, keyboard to 
keyboard conversation.

Leandra received her novice license in 1974 as a sophomore in high school.  She worked her way through 
General, Advanced and Extra (each time required a visit to the Boston Custom House) by the time I graduated from high school.

She was somewhat active in College (Electrical Engineering was too intense to be able to spend hours operating), and had her first chance to try RTTY (real mechanical RTTY with paper and punched tape) and SSTV at the club station.  She was active for a few years after graduation.

She organized the ham radio safety team for ten years in the 1990’s for the Auto Hillclimb at the Mount Washington Mountain Auto Road, and organized the ham radio safety team at the Maine Forest Rally for the first three years of the event.

Leandra was inactive from the early 2000’s to about 2018, and is now active in contesting, POTA, and the keyboard digital modes. 

She is a member of ARRL, YLRL, MMRA, Wellesley Amateur Radio Society, Waltham Amateur Radio Association, PODXS 070 club, and the Feld Hell Club.

15 June Business Meeting ~ Minutes ~ via ZOOM

Called to order @ 7:31 PM

HamXposition
Larry – W1DYJ – States he needs HamXposition information by August 1st to allow time for it to be published in the August MMRA Newsletter. 
The discussion involved what will be needed to make HamXposition successful. Dave – N1DCH – asked about the signage. Dave says Bob – K1IW – has the banners
Kevin – K1KWP – said the signage needs to increase traffic and questioned are we allowed to hang signs on the walls. Kevin will be in charge of the money. Also mentioned was breakfast and that he will pay for a box(s) of coffee and doughnut holes. 
Howard – AC1MN – offered to volunteer for Friday night setup. 
In Summary the discussion focused on the logistics of our location, signage and manpower, i.e. who is covering the MMRA Booth, who will have the keys to our room (one of the few rooms that locks), the raffle tickets, parking for dropping off equipment, the Fox Box.  With these details not fully ironed out it was suggested having an early August Meeting either on the 1st or 2nd Wednesday, but it was finally decided to have our next business meeting on the 3rd Wednesday of July. During the interim we will be communicating by an exchange of emails with the July meeting set for finalizing these details. 

Raffle Tickets: (information supplied from Jason and Dave)
This is from last year raffle signs: 
7 tickets - $10.00
3 Tickets - $5.00
1 Ticket - $2.00
A two year renewal will receive 2 raffle tickets (same as last year)

2022 Ticket Drawing Prizes:
1st Price = Icom IC-2300H (at HRO $199.95)

20 July Business Meeting ~ Minutes ~ via ZOOM

Called to order @ 7:10 PM

Repeater & Tech Update:
Referring to last month’s slide from Bob – K1IW – the equipment and parts ordered for the Weston Repeater have not arrived yet. Estimate is for a September delivery. As stated last month, the Antenna for the Billerica Repeater has been received with installation probably in late August or September. Volunteer(s) will be needed to climb the tower safely. There is still no output tone on North Reading and 6 meters is still intermittent.

On the matter concerning the Pru Bob summarized what was stated in the emails that the Diamond X30 must be replaced. It is only a 3db gain and should be replaced with a dual band. We will define it as one unit connected by one cable. This will likely be for October. Many replacement commercial antennas have been discontinued so a cost estimate cannot be specific. Bob’s guess is around $800 and with shipping suggests we “not to exceed $1,000”.

Dave – N1DCH – made this into a motion and was seconded. This will be sent to the Membership electronically for a vote not exceeding $1,000.00. 

HamXposition
Larry – W1DYJ –asked about the signs for W1A, the YCCC station, so we might piggy-back on it. 
Bob – K1IW – has the W1A sign and will send a “vector graph” of it to Larry. 
Dave – N1DCH – will provide Mast, 50’ of Coax and repair material, if needed, on the coax. Larry - W1DYJ - will bring the Radio and Antenna for the talk-in station. 
Kevin – K1KWP – will set up the repeater links Saturday morning on 147.270, 449.925 and 223.940.
Larry – W1DYJ – provided a spreadsheet slide for the MMRA HamXposition Project Plan which he can provide to anyone as needed. 
Stephen – KC1LPZ – referring to last month’s meeting minutes asked about the Keys. Dave will have one and prefers having two for our room, which should be provided by the Hotel. 
We need two laptops: one for the Membership database and the second one for our presentation if K1KWP’s old TV does not work. 
John – WA1MDD – has a laptop he can provide. 
We will have the Presentation Room for 50 minutes. Kevin – K1KWP – will be doing the Presentation (about 20-30 minutes, 10 minutes for the raffle and Fox Box results about 5 minutes and any other questions or miscellaneous matters. 
Larry - W1DYJ – will be doing a 4 page newsletter for HamXposition. There will be a President’s Corner, List of Repeaters and Officers and other relevant material on this event. 
Kevin will take charge of MMRA involvement in this event, particularly expenditures like Coffee. Note too with things opening up participants should be able to get food and drink without MMRA paying for it. 
Stephen – KC1LPZ – referring to the emails brought up the subject of the MMRA Logo(s). 
Dave – N1DCH – stated we will be using the gold logo, but any of our past logos are fine so this is a non-issue. 
Larry – W1DYJ – used the HamXposition schedule slide as initially it was asked how early must we be at our booth. The ARRL Keynote Speaker is scheduled for 9 AM Saturday so a 9 AM start is fine and can set up our room starting at 8 AM. 

Meeting Attendees:
John Spencer, Dave Hornbaker, Kevin Paetzoid, Larry Banks, Bob DeMattia, Stephen Babbitt, 
Roger Coulson, Howard Shpegel, Mike Rioux.

This Meeting was Adjourned at 8:12 PM.

New Communications Analyzer

During the May Annual Meeting we approved an expenditure of up to $2000 to replace our very old analyzer box.  Our “new” one has arrived (photo 1)

Here it is doing something our old one could not do: it is transmitting on a repeater input while we monitor the repeater output.  (Photo 2)

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), and Hopkinton (449.575).  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially
important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
