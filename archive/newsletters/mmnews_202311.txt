A Smorgasbord of Radio - the People Places and Incidents.
DOMENIC ‘DOM’ MALLOZZI, N1DM

This is a Hybrid meeting: Marlborough Central Fire Station+ ZOOM
Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

Do you know what the most powerful radio station in New England is?  Let's find out.

Dom will discuss some of the less known contributors to the development of radio, the operational sites in New England that brought radio from a laboratory oddity to a functional system along with discussing the affect of the sinking of the Titanic on radio regulation.

Licensed initially as WN1RFT in 1972 and now holds an Amateur Extra class license and FCC “General Radio Operators License”

Dom started as a shortwave listener when young and eventually found his way through a local ham, Jim K1CBF, to the Providence Radio Association, W1OP.  He took his licensing classes at the club in high school and eventually obtained an amateur extra class license.  He also built a lot of Heathkits, many of which he still has and uses.

Dom received a Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Rhode 
Island which led to a 38-year career as an electrical engineer at the Raytheon Co. in various Massachusetts locations specializing in measurement systems.

His ham radio interests are: CW, Antennas, 160 meters, satellites, homebrewing and DMR.

20 September 2023 Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:30 PM 

Repeater Status Report – from Bob DeMattia – K1IW –   
[Editors note: this is the repeater status as of 20 September. ]
Boston Prudential Repeater 146.82 – is off the air. It appears the transmitter, which is running very low power, has now failed completely. It is still able to receive signals on its input and send them to the HUB and can still receive signals from the HUB, but without the transmitter, nothing can be heard on the ’82 output. Bob tried a power cycle, but this did not help. K1IW has completely shut it down for the time being, The new repeater is in K1IW’s garage. This has priority and hopefully Bob will have it ready in the next few weeks.
Brookline – Remote RX has been removed. The DSTAR repeater is still there
Weston – The 146.79 2M – Planned trip to Campion Center with NN1C on 9/26 to inspect the antenna. The former Brookline antenna has already been brought to the Weston Site in case it is needed. Bob stated the antenna tests fine and suspects the problem is with the old receiver.
North Reading –146.715 - Spring cleanup completed on June 10th with the site upgraded to prevent rodents from getting inside. The new Kenwood that was ordered and approved by Club Vote has still not been delivered. It may be delayed up to January as a guess so it is possible Bob will look for another alternative replacement around a similar price range. Right now we are waiting for the Kenwood.
Burlington – 224.880 – Still reported a 5 second drop out during the TIOS Net. Since Bob can not access the Burlington Repeater from his home, he cannot verify or refute the drop out issue.
Boston 900 Machine will be the Quantar. Bob suggests replacing the fans in it when it is received.

Presentation:  The National traffic System, Nets in the area and the Basics of 
sending a radiogram – by Marcia Forde, KW1U & Joe Weisse, W1HAI
The use of the Radiogram is based on the Telegram. The Radiogram is a structured messaging system with a Header, messaging portion and end portion identifying who is sending the message. Radiograms can be in CW or Voice form sent over the air. Please refer to the QST – July, 2023 pp 64-65 that describes the history of NTS (National Traffic System) to Its current status and the future plans for NTS 2.0 as technology continues to evolve. Marcia described the basics of messaging accuracy by demonstrating a short message to Joe. In general messages are handled by prioritizing its importance: Emergency, Priority, Welfare and Routine. Joe described some interesting history on how the “Heavy Hitters” Net evolved around the 1970s. It started with the Waltham group when they were playing softball against Malden. The softball competition was quite competitive with some heavy hitters winning the competition. The name heavy hitters stuck and was applied to the local radiogram net. There are many radiogram nets, but the Heavy Hitters Net is distinctive to us here as they will also teach new hams, who decide to participate, the skills needed to prepare for emergency as well as routine situations.

18 October 2023 Business Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:32 PM 

Treasurer’s Report: - By Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP
Kevin provided extensive details with charts and graphs depicting the MMRA financial picture. In summary the MMRA has had expenses exceeding income since FY 2020. For the year that ended May 31, 2023, total income was $7,583 with donations slightly shy of 17 percent. In round numbers the MMRA has $23K with a projected balance of $17k based on equipment replacement or upgrading of our 20+ repeaters, many of which are decades in age. 

Repeater Report:
[Editors note: this is the repeater status as of 18 October.]

Boston Prudential Repeater 146.82 – is off the air. New repeater is in K1IW garage, it is scheduled to be installed on Saturday, November 4th.
Brookline – Remote RX has been removed. The DSTAR repeater is still there.
Weston – The 146.79 2M – Visited Campion Center with NN1C on 9/26 to inspect and possibly replace antenna. SWR still 2:1 at the radio end, but weather was not cooperative.
10m Repeater – Weston – I found that RF pre-amp on receiver provided 0dB gain. Preamp removed. Repeater is back on air. Receiver breaks squelch at -108dBM – a bit deaf. Antenna still checks out good. We should probably replace the receiver.
North Reading –146.715 - Replacement not received from Kenwood, anticipating January delivery.
Burlington – 224.88 - Bob suspects drop-outs occur when there is doubling/heterodyning
on ‘925. It appears the ‘88 link radio is more sensitive to this than others. Will try
putting the link radio in CSQ mode for next week’s Net.
900 MHz Repeater - The MMRA was offered a new 900 MHz Motorola Quantar. If and when we receive one, it will be used to replace the MSF5000 in Boston.
Belmont – 145.43 – had been reported a few weeks ago on the TIOS Tuesday evening net to be timing out. At least three of us had us to use other repeaters to access the Net. The current homeowner, where the repeater is located, will be putting her home on the market for sale. An alternate site will need to be located.
	
AREDN – Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network
Kevin brought up where we left off with their impressive two-part presentation. With no volunteers from us, this appears it has little appeal to the MMRA. Kevin will follow up with Michael Ford, WZ0C & Jim Gardner, KC1BHD, who are promoting AREDN, with a few suggestions.

Repeater Report ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW [as of 4 November 2023]


Boston Prudential Repeater 146.82 – is off the air. New repeater is running in K1IW garage, it is scheduled to be installed on Sunday, November 5th. 
Brookline – Remote RX has been removed. The DSTAR repeater is on the air.
Weston 146.79 – Visited Campion Center with NN1C on 9/26 to inspect and possibly replace antenna.  SWR still 2:1 at the radio end.  Weather was not cooperative.
Marlborough 10m 29.68 – The repeater has been deaf for some long period of time. The problem has been traced to the receiver end in Weston. The RF pre-amp provided 0dB gain. Preamp removed. Receiver is in the shop - front end realigned and sensitivity is now about -118dBm.  Going to do some further work on it, but it should be back on the air in the next few weeks.
North Reading 146.715 - Club voted replacement not yet received from Kenwood.  Order cancelled at current supplier and ordered from someone else.  Repeater has shipped and should arrive next week.
Burlington 224.88 - Bob suspects drop-outs occur when there is doubling/heterodyning on ‘925. It appears the ‘88 link radio is more sensitive to this than others. Will try putting the link radio in CSQ mode during a future TIOS net.
900 MHz Repeater - The MMRA was offered a new 900 MHz Motorola Quantar. If and when we receive one, it will be used to replace the MSF5000 in Boston.  Person has not been responsive to further inquiries.
Belmont  145.43 – Is off the air.  It will be rebuilt and relocated to a different location which is TBD.  Board to discuss at December board meeting..
The MMRA inherited this repeater many years ago from an SK and the family has graciously allowed us to leave the repeater at their home for many years, even funding electricity and our internet connection. We thank them for these many years of support.
We were informed in early October that the family was selling the house. The repeater was removed at the end of October.

Treasurer’s Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP


The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year.  On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank people below who donated since my list in the September newsletter:
	  K1VK, K1YSO, KC1FEH, KD1TE, N1CTY, N1HBR, and WG1V

We have 166 paid memberships at this time for the 2023-2024 year.  At this point 74 people would need to join or renew to reach parity with the 2022-2023 year (which ended on Aug 31, 2023).  However 113 members have not yet renewed and are in the grace period until Jan 1, 2024.

The funds balance was $22193.93 on June 1,2023.  At this writing on Oct 30, 2023 the balance is $23016.98.  Based on everything I know the balance on June 1,2024 is likely to be $17261.82.  This assumes we get enough memberships/renewals to reach parity with last year.   This also assume we will spend the all of the remaining $4186.93 of approved (by the membership) spending.

The N1CTY donation consisted of:
BTech UV25-X4 Mobile, Beofang F8-HP HT, Kenwood TH-F6A HT, Tram 2-band base antenna, Ed Fong 1-band base antenna, and a Pyramid 10amp Power Supply.  There are also many HT antennas and accessories including large capacity batteries, drop in charger, USB programming cables for the above.

This is pretty much a full setup (base and HT) for anyone wanting a 144, 220, 440 station.  All of this seems in perfect/new condition.   The BTECH UV25 looks very interesting.   It is small enough it does not need a remote head for mobile use.  The initial plan is to try to avoid EBay fees and try to sell much of this at upcoming Flea (like the Marlboro flea).

If you are interested in any of the above send email to contact@mmra.org.   Reasonable offers only please.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (449.575) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
