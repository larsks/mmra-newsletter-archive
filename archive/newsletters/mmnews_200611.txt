President's Corner ~ Bob Dematia, K1IW 
With our second meeting of the year just around the corner, this is the time 
where the MMRA board starts looking at those members who have not yet renewed. 
As I am writing this, that number stands at 57. I'm comparing this to the 
members lost from 2004 and 2005, and it looks quite large. In 2004, we lost 6 
members, in 2005 that number was 15. We typically will get another 50% of 
what we have now, but that still means we'll lose about 30. This is not good. 
You've probably heard this before, but it is worth repeating. Almost all of 
MMRA's operating income comes from dues. This revenue is necessary for 
paying the electric bills and rent, as well as equipment repair and upgrades. In 
the past year, MMRA has made some important investments in its infrastructure. 
The Diamond X-500 antennas at Stoneham (one for VHF, the other for 
UHF) were replaced after many years of service. We also placed the new 
Brookline 146.820 machine in service. Though much of the radio equipment for 
'82 was donated, we still had to purchase the antennas and feedlines as well as 
the controller. (By the way, yes, this new system is still having problems and is 
currently off line while we work out the bugs). 
If you have already renewed your membership, thank you very much! If 
you haven't, please consider doing so as soon as possible. We make it 
easy for you by offering an online payment system - simply go to http://www. 
mmra.org/access.html to see your membership status and renew it - or you can 
still renew the "old-fashioned" way via pony express. 
73, Bob - K1IW

Software Defined Radios 
15 November 2006 @ 7 PM [not 7:30!] 
Milton Public Library ~ 476 Canton Avenue Milton, Massachusets 
SOUTH SHORE 
Dr. Gregory D. Troxel, N1DAM 
Greg is a network researcher at BBN Technologies working on cognitive teams of software radios 
for the Department of Defense 
Greg will give an overview of software-defined radios, a new technology that is already changing Ham Radio. He will 
talk about a free software radio package called GNU Radio. Greg will also describe a hardware front end for software 
radios the USRP that uses daughter-boards for various functions, from VHF and UHF receivers, to boards for IF 
use, and to transceivers for 440, 902, 1296 and 2400 MHz. Greg's talk will highlight the challenges in changing GNU 
Radio from receiving continuous signals to packet radio. Following the talk, Greg will demonstrate GNU Radio and 
the USRP with several daughter-boards. Come and hear about the future of Ham Radio!

October Board Meeting 
Bob Evans, N1BE ~ Clerk 
The MMRA Board met at 7:00 PM in the Westborough 
Library on 18 October. Present were K1IW, 
K1KWP, N1BDA, N1NVK, W1WH, K1VEA and 
N1BE. The following summarizes the discussion. 
Kevin, K1KWP gave the Treasurer's report, summarizing 
MMRA's finances. We looked at final numbers 
for the past fiscal year ending on August 31st 
and a projection of our funds through the current 
MMRA fiscal year. We had many two-year renewals 
at Boxboro, motivated by the free raffle tickets 
for anyone who renewed for more than one year. 
The financial projection splits the multi-year renewals 
between this year and the other years for which 
renewal was paid. Planned expenses for the current 
year exceed income received thus far by about 
$140. We hope to make this up with renewals that 
are outstanding, from about 55 MMRA members 
have not yet renewed. This report was accepted by 
a unanimous vote. 
Bob, K1IW, presented a proposal for more flexible 
and easier to use repeater linking. This is a followup 
of his action item from the June 2006 board 
meeting. The primary change is that in addition to 
the MMRA hub in Marlboro, the 442.7 MHz repeater 
in Weston would be capable of acting as a 
hub. All sites except for Echolink and W1OJ's 10 
Meter repeater would be capable of linking to either 
of the hubs, and Weston would still be capable of 
linking to Marlboro. Benefits of this include more 
reliability by having an alternate hub. Linking 
would be more flexible since it is possible to separate 
MMRA sites into two arbitrary sets of linked 
repeaters. User codes would change to simpler 
codes that would no longer require an access code 
prefix. This proposal included new diagrams of the 
MMRA repeater system (see next page) with affiliated 
repeaters, new lists of user and control operator 
codes, and an itemized list of equipment changes 
necessary to implement this new scheme. With 
K1IW abstaining, the board voted to purchase a radio 
and necessary crystals to implement this plan 
with the expenditure not to exceed $300. 
Kevin, K1KWP, led a discussion exploring reclassifying 
the MMRA as a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organization. 
Currently, we are classified as 501(c) 
(7). The primary motivation for this change is that 
dues and gifts to the MMRA would become taxdeductible 
and this would improve the possibility to 
receive grants for improvement to the repeater system. 
The cost to make this change is perhaps 80 
hours work to fill in forms and bylaw changes including 
a succession policy if all board members 
could not serve and a conflict of interest policy. 
Additional on-going work would include recording 
all board votes by each member and filing annual 
tax returns. We are watching as FEMARA goes 
through a similar reclassification process. Kevin 
offered to begin organizing the information needed 
for the application even though we have not decided 
to make this change. 
In their MMRA member info, W1WH, N1AP, and 
W1JMC expressed interest in grant application writing. 
The board requested that they talk with the MA 
State RACES Radio Officer, N1CPE, about whom 
to contact for MEMA funding of emergency communications 
infrastructure improvements. We envision 
improvements to linking, and adding battery 
backup power to our sites as the kind of things that 
would be of value to MEMA. 
We discussed the cost and extra effort required to 
produce paper newsletters. Notably, many other 
clubs either no longer produce paper newsletters, or 
they require a larger dues payment for printing and 
postage. No action was taken on this issue. 
We received notification that Bill, WA1NLR, has 
resigned his post of MMRA Director. The MMRA 
Board wants to acknowledge a great debt and 
thank Bill for his numerous contributions to the 
club over many years. We plan to refill this director 
seat at the May annual meeting. Given the vacancy, 
we request nominations for this board seat. 
The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM.

Repeater Update ~ Bob Dematia, K1IW 
The MMRA system has a number of issues right 
now: As some members have noticed, the new 
146.820 repeater in Brookline has been taken off the 
air. Ongoing problems with intermod has forced us 
to remove this repeater from service and bring it 
back to the shop for additional work. As part of this 
refurbishment, the system will be getting a new link 
radio and will have the various cavities and filters in 
the transmission system retuned and/or replaced. 
To increase accessibility, the '82 machine will soon 
be placed back in service at the old Marlborough 
East site. We will give it a good work out here before 
putting it back in Brookline. 
The 146.715 repeater in Stoneham appears to be 
having receiver problems. It is certainly outtransmitting 
what it can hear. This is going to need 
to be looked at soon. 
The link radio for 146.670 has been intermittent - 
although the transmitter works, meaning we can 
hear conversations from '67 on the HUB, the receiver 
sometimes stops - meaning people on '67 
cannot hear the HUB. Bryan suspects the cause of 
this to be the radio getting too warm. It is physically 
located near the 222 power amp. A few 
months ago, the fan on this power amp failed and 
thus the link receiver gets cooked. 
On a more positive note, progress is still being 
made on getting the 442.700 repeater in Weston 
online. Once it is on the air, it will serve as a second 
HUB for the MMRA system. Over time, each 
repeater in the MMRA network will be outfitted 
with a 2-channel link radio, capable of operating 
into either the 449.925 HUB or the new 442.700 
HUB. This will provide us with more flexibility as 
to how the repeaters are configured, and will also 
give us some redundancy for when one of the two 
HUBs fails. The before and after diagrams of the 
MMRA network are shown below. 
Roger, W1OJ, owner/operator of the 29.62 10m repeater 
to which MMRA '27 links, will be making 
some changes to his system soon. He is rebuilding 
the 448.625 UHF repeater located on Mt. Wachusett, 
and this repeater will be full-time linked to 
29.62. MMRA will begin linking to 10M through 
our 449.925 HUB, rather than 147.27. This will allow 
us to link different 2m repeaters rather than 
having to use '27. The MMRA board is seeking 
your opinion on the best default state for the network 
- so let us know what you think.

Larry Banks, W1DYJ 
Most of the MMRA's repeaters are linked 
every Tuesday night for the MMRA TIAOS 
Net. Join us! Over the past two months we 
averaged seven participants with a high of 
ten. This is a good way to keep up with 
what is happening with the MMRA as well 
as ask your ham related questions. 
We are looking for a net control operator for 
the first Tuesday of each month.  contact 
me at W1DYJ@mmra.org if you would like 
to try your hand at running a net some evening 
 we have a script that you can use to 
start with. This is good practice for a number 
of ham related operations, from emergency 
preparedness to contesting.
