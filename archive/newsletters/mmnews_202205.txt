Since the advent of the telegraph in the 19th century, human technologies have been steadily increasing in size and complexity.  As we move forward towards a fully space faring society, successful operational use of systems that cross continents, oceans, and even space requires an increasingly sophisticated understanding of weather beyond near-ground levels, out in the coupled Sun-Earth system.  These fluctuations are known as space weather.  Knowledge of space weather and space climate is critical to maintaining important technological systems, and has been recently named as both a White House and Congressional priority.

However, research into space weather is not just the domain of professional observing systems.  A growing number of national and international amateur-professional partnerships are now emerging that seek to use a common interest and participation in communications over long distances.  These activities use information on QSOs, frequency shifts, and other data from contacts and observations across the radio spectrum.   In this talk, I will provide an overview of space weather fundamentals, describe historical space weather work by hams, and will introduce the activities of the Ham Science Citizen Initiative (HamSCI) national amateur-professional partnership (https://hamsci.org).  HamSCI's organized QSO parties and low-cost instrument development provide a scientifically unique way for the ham community to be involved in fundamental discovery within this fascinating part of our planet's atmosphere.    		

Dr. Philip J. Erickson, W1PJE, holds a PhD from Cornell University in space physics.  He is head of the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences group, a Principal Research Scientist, and an associate director at Haystack Observatory, a multidisciplinary radio observatory operated by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Dr. Erickson is a member of ARRL, RSGB, and TAPR, and vice president of the Nashoba Valley Amateur Radio Club.  He is a steering committee member for HamSCI and is a member of the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine’s Committee on Radio Frequencies, which advocates on scientific radio frequency requirements and interference protection for scientific and engineering research.

Candidate for Clerk: Howard Shpegel ~ AC1MN
I passed the test for my First-Class Radiotelephone license in 1977 as it was required for my job at CBS Television. All the best techs at CBS were hams so I wanted to be one too.  Life got in the way and it took 53 years for me to become one. My Extra Class License was granted on the 22 of February this year and I immediately began learning Morse code. I’m on the Field Day committee with Algonquin ARC and hope to be on the air by then making CW QSOs. For now, I plan to build all my HF equipment and have already completed my (tr)SDX radio. It might even work but until I get my antenna up, it’s hard to be sure.

Repeater Report ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW

On 22 April, Mike W1USN, Bruce KC1US and I installed the new Billerica repeater, including the link radio and link antenna.  This is the equipment from 1200RC that was accepted last year by the MMRA board.  In addition to the old Mastr II/Kendecom which was the current 147.12 repeater at the time, 1200RC gave us a Kenwood TKR-750, Astron Power Supply, SCOM 7330 controller, and control receiver radio.  MMRA has a spare Mastr II 100W power amp which I adapted to work with the Kenwood.  Last winter, I built this into a repeater in my garage.  

1200RC is also paying for a new DB224-E four-bay dipole antenna. This is on back order and is expected to arrive in May.  When it does, we will schedule another visit to the site to replace the aging Stationmaster.

In other news, since my last update, the new Quincy repeater was installed several weeks ago.  The 2m is a Kenwood NXR710 into a Henry Power amplifier, the 220 is a Spectra Engineering MX800.  Both are installed into the rack that formerly held the old Marlborough 223.94 machine.

Finally, the Weston 2M power amplifier has been off and on lately.   The MMRA board voted to put a motion at our May meeting to purchase replacement equipment for Weston 2m - a setup identical to the new Quincy.  In the meantime, MMRA's Yaesu DR1X backup repeater has been installed in Weston.

As a side note, MMRA's service monitor has been very flaky lately.  The board will also be putting a motion at or May meeting to purchase a replacement.  With 23 repeaters to maintain, this is a necessary tool to have in our portfolio
----------

W1DC Repeater News ~ Bruce Pigott, KC1US

Details about the equipment installed in Billerica can be found at https://www.mmra.org/repeaters/BCA/ The 
system will have the same capabilities and features as other MMRA sites. The 1200 Radio Club remaining members – Mike W1USN and Mike K1TWF, are thanked for the transfer and for donations for repeater components and 
operation. The remaining funds have been donated to the F.E.M.A.R.A. scholarship fund.
----------

Treasurer’s Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP

The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year.  On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank people below who donated since my list in the January newsletter: AB1HO, W1RFF, KC1IUN, and KB1MQF.   Hopefully I did not leave anyone off (and if I did I am sorry).

The MMRA fiscal year ends on May 31 which is 13 days after the May meeting and the elections.  If there are open financial matters for the club (like for example the club owes you money) then please let me know.

It may seem like the club has been spending significant money on the system this year.   However more than $3K of the equipment that was replaced/upgraded has been sold so far.  At the time of this writing our actual funds for this fiscal year are down by 5% (about $1600) from June 1, 2021.
----------

The WR1 callsign – what is it ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW

When we installed the new Billerica repeater, Mike W1USN removed a placard from the old repeater and placed it on the new one.  The placard reads “WR1APB Amateur Radio Repeater, 147.72 in, 147.12 out”.    Newer hams probably don’t remember the old “WR” calls.  Back in the 70’s, the FCC required a special repeater license.  To
obtain this license, you actually had to provide the technical details of the operation – transmitter power, etc.  The license was specific to that particular system.  If anything changed, you had to modify the license.  If you had more than one repeater at a location, each one had to have its own callsign.

While I doubt anybody would want to go back to that, the “WR” callsigns sounded kind of nice in CW.  The FCC
officially ended issuing “WR”s in 1983.  Current holders could use the callsign until the license expired, at which point they couldn’t renew them.

Due to an FCC glitch, a few people were able to keep their WR’s under the vanity callsign system until 2004.  But aside from this exception, repeater operators had to switch to the trustee’s callsign with a “/R” at the end.  At some point, I was unable to determine when, the “/R” requirement was dropped.  Although many repeater groups still use the “/R” suffix, MMRA does not.

	Belmont 	145.43				WR1AFO
	Billerica 	147.12				WR1ABP
	Marlborough 	146.61 (now in Mendon)		WR1AAH
	Marlborough 	147.27				WR1AGI
	Quincy 		146.67				WR1AAI
	Stoneham 	146.715 (now in North Reading)	WR1AIW
	Weston 		146.82 (frequency now 146.79)	WR1ABJ

MMRA FoxBox Deployed Again ~ Rob Evans, N1BE

The MMRA Fox Box transmits on 145.63 MHz with a 146.2 Hz PL.  Transmissions repeat approx. every 165 seconds.  The box was hidden where it can be heard in the towns of Hudson and Stow MA until May 2.
  These hams found it:  	Gary, KD1TE	Mike, K1MJC	Pat,  K1PJW

It will be hidden again...

MMRA uses the fox box to train for locating repeater interference.  This is a longer distance hunt than ARDF.  Therefore the transmitter power is higher and search area is larger.  (Fox is on low power ~150mW this weekend -- future hunts may use 2.3W.) 



Leave a note in the "mailbox" at the left end of the box to report your success. 
Email me directly if you want a hint to help locate the fox.


Happy hunting, Bob—N1BE

   Moved: W1DYJ, to present the slate at the annual meeting in May
   Seconded: W1HFP
   Voted: unanimous
   Action Item:  Steve and Howard were asked to submit a paragraph or two to the newsletter for publication 
before the annual meeting and election.

Recent Repeater Updates – Bob, K1IW
   220: All four MX800’s are now in service at Burlington, Quincy, Weston, and Marlborough
      The Burlington repeater was in very bad shape and was sent to electronic recycling
      Old equipment from Marlborough was sold for pretty much what we paid for that MX800
      Quincy MastrII sold for $225. The amp, if repairable, should fetch about the same, so we will break even in Quincy too.
         Post-meeting: Bob has repaired the power amp and it is back on eBay
      Weston Henry amp sold for $200. The receiver/transmitters should fetch another $100 -$200
         Post-meeting: Bob has cleaned up these boxes and they are now on eBay
   Editor’s note: Thanks to Bob, K1IW, for all of this work and $$$ recovery!!!

   New Quincy 2M is in service –reports have been excellent
 
   All other systems running normally except
      North Reading –no TX PL tone
      Weston –rx/txPL board is bad –frequency is around 199.2Hz, but it drifts up and down
      Weston –TX PA is intermittent
   New Billerica install to happen on Friday – this should make it linkable.  {Note: done}
      Main antenna is on back order and probably won’t be installed until June.
   MRE tree work complete: done April 4th
      This is good for now, but may need additional work in about five years

Current Repeater Status – Bob, K1IW
   The Good – all recent technology:
      HUB1, HUB2, Quincy and Billerica -Kenwood systems (c . 2015)
      All 222’s are now MX800’s (c. 2005)
      Hopkinton and North Reading UHF are Yaesu DR2X’s (c. 2012)
   The Bad
      Weston 2m (c. 1985), currently has two problems, one of which has already been fixed once
   The Ugly:
      North Reading 2m, Mendon, Boston 2m, Lowell, Brookline are MastrII’s (c. 1985)
      Belmont is a pair of GM300’s (c. 1990) and is essentially un-reparable
      The antennas are on a tower that cannot be climbed safely
      If they fail, we will not have a repeater at that site

Future Planning – Bob, K1IW
   We should consider a plan for replacement of the older MastrII equipment. My (K1IW’s) priority would be:
      Weston – as previously stated
      North Reading – has had PA issues in the past, now has the tone issue
      Boston – seems to be running OK
      Mendon – OK
      Lowell – Squelch is a little strange on it, but otherwise OK
      Brookline – DSTAR – would be more difficult to replace
   Discussion:
      A Kenwood/Henry combination for 2M costs about $2500 (our current “standard” configuration.)
      A New Policy: after much discussion, we agreed that these old 2M repeaters should no longer be
repaired when they fail; they need to be replaced.
      We will use the “spare” repeater in the short run as a replacement
      We will use the $2500 emergency repair fund to purchase a new repeater
      We will subsequently ask the membership to replenish the emergency fund. (After the meeting this was raised to $3000.)

   Weston 2m – 146.79
      This has continuing issues with its old hardware
      Moved: K1IW, to recommend to the annual meeting that we spend up to $3000 to purchase and
replace the Weston 2m hub
      Seconded: KC1LPZ
      Voted: unanimous
      Post-Meeting: Bob installed our backup DR1X. Weston 2m is back up.

New Repeater Business
   Service Monitor – Bob, K1IW
      Our venerable (and vulnerable) Service Monitor is on its last legs, having slowly had parts of its
 functionality fail over the past few years
      It weighs 40 pounds and is hard to drag to our various repeater sites
      It was “pre-owned” when we bought it many years ago.
      New ones are much smaller, lighter, and powerful – but they can be expensive
      Used ones are also available a reduced cost
      Moved: K1IW, to recommend to the annual meeting that we spend up to $2000 to purchase and
replace our old service monitor
      Seconded: N1BE
      Voted: unanimous

10M Repeater
   Given that sunspots are coming back, the interest in our 10m repeater (29.68 MHz) has recently increased
   It appears to be a bit deaf, although it “talks well.”  (The definition of an alligator…)
   Current linking information:
      10m is currently linked to Hub 1 during the Tuesday night TIOS Net
      It is also linked during the day to Weston 2m from 9 am to 3 pm local
   Before any further effort is focused on 10m, we need to assess the current situation
      N1DCH and W1DYJ have stated that they will be looking into antennas for their shacks to access the repeater
      No date for reporting success has been recorded

HamXposition
   August 26-28 in Marlborough

   Raffle prizes
      Jason, W1HFP, volunteered to obtain the prizes
      Moved: N1DCH, to purchase three prizes, not to exceed $500
      Seconded: K1KWP
      Voted: unanimous

   Room – Better signage leading to room?
      W1DYJ volunteered to approach the YCCC to partner for signs
      Staffing of room – we need people!!!
      Table in the main hall near the room might increase foot traffic
      After discussion, probably not a good idea
      Refreshments? – A good idea, more thought needs be done.  Is there a Hotel issue?

   Radio and Antenna for talk-in
      W1DYJ volunteered a 2m mobile rig and 2m/440 “stick” antenna
      K1KWP volunteered a power supply
      N1DCH volunteered an antenna mast and tripod
      Links to be used: 147.270, 449.925, 223.94, 53.81

   Potential Flea Market Table
      Does it make sense for the MMRA to purchase a table in the Flea, to promote the MMRA, and 
potentially sell member’s equipment: at a 20% commission???

   FoxBox – should we activate the FoxBox again???
      N1BE and K1KWP to collaborate

New Business
None came before the meeting

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), and Hopkinton (449.575).  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially
important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
