November Membership Meeting ~ Wednesday, 16 November, 7 PM

Linux in the Hamshack
Andy Stewart, KB1OIQ 
There's a lot of good, free software out there to make our hobby more fun and operating easier.  Come hear about it from Andy.

Andy has been running Linux user groups since 1997, and taught Linux classes for several years in Chelmsford.  Two students, who were hams, convinced Andy to become a ham in 2007.  



Andy has been the President of the Police Amateur Radio Team (PART) in Westford for the last 8 years, and holds an amateur extra license.  He created "Andy's Ham Radio Linux" in 2011 as a way to give back to both the ham and Linux communities.  Andy is also an ARRL Assistant Section Manager for EMA.



Andy has a master's degree in electrical engineering from WPI, and by day works as a digital logic verification 
engineer.

Other interesting data:

Membership Renewals at MMRA suite: 17
New members joined at MMRA suite: 4
MMRA Door Prize Tickets sold at MMRA suite: 178
Others from donations and recent renewals ~ 455 tickets total
Free MMRA membership applications (VE) at Boxboro sessions: 19

DMR was discussed at the recent MMRA Board Meeting and the board determined that incorporation of new DMR repeaters or modification of existing FM repeaters was not in MMRA's best interest. Besides, there are no 2M frequency pairs available for a new repeater, and adding a 440MHz repeater may be impacted by PAVE PAWS.   In addition, eastern MA is already sufficiently covered by DMR repeaters and sorry to say that ham activity on these DMR repeaters appears to be sparse. 

MMRA has been awarding free one year memberships to new hams passing the VE Session examinations.  As the free memberships are only valid for one year, those who have not renewed will be deleted from the membership roster.  The MMRA is using these free memberships to attract new hams with fresh ideas, so please do renew.  Renewal can be done on-line at   http://www.mmra.org/renew.html.

Stored in Hopkinton are about a dozen rolls of 50? foam core 1 5/8" diameter heliax cable with DIN connectors.  These are used but in good condition, about 165 ft of length in each roll.  The board moved to approve sale of these cables at $300 per roll.  If interested, send an email to W1DYJ@mmra.org with the number of rolls you would like to purchase.  The rolls must be picked up in Hopkinton.  

A first draft of a next fiscal year budget proposal was presented at the recent board meeting.  The intent is to develop this document further for approval by the board in April, and presentation to the membership for vote at the general meeting in May.  This would let us work more with a plan and less in reaction to unfolding events during the fiscal year that begins on June 1, 2017.

Bob, K1IW, presented a plan for technical improvements to the MMRA system.  The board took action on some of these items and noted others for the future.  A key aspect of this proposal is a new type of repeater controller under development by James, N1DDK.  Ultimately, the new controllers would be used at sites that host multiple repeaters and the other sites would get the SCom controllers that are capable of Internet control.  Thus all MMRA repeaters could be controlled via the internet.  Bob expects this project would take 3-years for development and deployment.

Quincy Update ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW
Photos: Bryan Cerqua, W1BRI
146.67 and 224.40 are rebuilt, back on the air at full power, and linkable.  

The MMRA Quincy repeater first went on the air in the mid-70's from the Quincy city hospital.  In the early 1980's, American Cablesystems wanted to install a cable headend at the hospital.  MMRA was forced to move, but was able to find an equally good site not too far away on Forbes Hill.  The castle-like structure, clearly visible from I-93, actually surrounds a steel standpipe.  The standpipe and granite building were built at the turn of the century (the 20th century, not the recent one) as part of the Quincy water supply system.  When built, the roof was open  to the public as an observation deck.  Space is tight inside this structure, as there is only about three feet between the granite wall and the steel standpipe inside! 

Earlier in the summer, the thirty-year-old repeater controller began to misbehave, most likely due to a deterioration of the lithium power cell used to retain the programming.  The controller began to lose programming code, causing it to behave erratically.  The MMRA board chose to replace the controller rather than fix it.  In the process, the "hodgepodge" arrangement of the 2m repeater and 222 repeater would be rebuilt into one compact setup, entirely within the Mastr-II rack panel.

To accomplish the work, the entire repeater was removed and brought to K1IW's garage where it could be taken apart and reconstructed.  MMRA's portable DR1X repeater was put into service to keep 146.67 on the air during this two month period.

Quincy Before (Two Photos)
Two meters in rack panel.  Short pieces of 2x4s used to keep things in place.  Old SCOM 7K with no display.  Linear power supply at bottom.  The 224.4 repeater was located on a shelf behind the rack, with each component kind-of sitting there.  Notice the width of the rack and the amount of space on either side to the walls.  That's all the space there is!

Quincy After (Two Photos)
All components are now located in one rack - and all bolted down.  You can turn this rack on its side (we did to get move it to the site) and nothing will move.  Notice the new SCOM 7330 controller (center) and new energy efficient switching power supply (bottom). The lightning protection and duplexers remain behind the main rack.

September Membership Meeting 
and Boxboro Update

The September Membership Meeting was held at the Boxboro 2016 ARRL New England Convention.  Bob, K1IW, presented a walk through of the MMRA repeater network, including a technical discussion of how linking is done.

A general Q&A period followed.

Two of our members gave talks at the convention: 

Rick Zack, K1RJZ, moderated a discussion about Digital Radio Repeater Modes.  Some of his introductory slides are shown below.  (There follows a number of images of Rick's slides.)

James Lee, N1DDK, gave two talks: Program Your Radios with Open Source Software ( CHIRP, highlighted in our September MMRA Newsletter,) and Care and Feeding of Astron Power Supplies.  James subsequently gave his CHIRP presentation as an ARRL Webinar.

October Business Meeting   Bob Evans, Clerk, N1BE

The MMRA board met for a business meeting at the office of Stratus in Maynard, MA at 7:00 PM on October 19.  In attendance were K1KWP, N1NVK, W1DYJ, W1BRI, N1BE, W1MPN, WA1NVC and K1IW.

Vice President Mike, W1MPN chaired the meeting in the absence of our president.

Mike reported on the MMRA participation at the Boxboro convention.  In the raffle, 455 tickets were in the drawing, 178 of which were sold at the convention.  This was profitable, MMRA proceeds were $205 compared to $140 in the previous year.  The board discussed a suggestion is to use this excess in some way to promote Amateur Radio as our participation at Boxboro is not for profit.  Mike also reported that dues were received for 17 member renewals and 4 new members; 19 free MMRA memberships were given to newly licensed hams at the VE sessions.

Kevin, K1KWP gave a treasurer's report that covered income and expenses, historical, year-to-date, and expectations for this fiscal year.  Of note, no free members from past years have renewed.  The recent power supply replacement at MRW reduced power cost about 30%.  We predict payback in less than two years.  The board moved to accept the treasure's report.

Mike then presented a first draft of a next fiscal year budget proposal.  The intent is we develop this document further for approval by the board April and presentation to the membership for vote at the general meeting in May.  This would let us work more with a plan and less in reaction to unfolding events during the fiscal year that begins on June 1, 2017.

Mike's proposal addresses the big picture of running the MMRA:  critical resources, maintenance, system improvements, operational costs, expected income, funding emergency repairs, contingency plans, managing donations and funding special projects.  This is very much a work in progress.  In addition to our comments at the meeting, Mike requested further feedback from the other board members.

We then briefly discussed whether MMRA would support DMR repeaters.  Our reasons for lack of DMR activity is two-fold.  First, the MMRA does not have sites that would enhance DMR coverage in EMA.  And because with today's technology DMR and analog FM do not co-exist on one repeater, we prefer to not lose rare 2-meter analog frequencies.

Stored in Hopkinton are about a dozen rolls of 50-ohm 1 5/8" diameter heliax cable with DIN connectors.  These are used but in good condition, about 165 ft of length in each roll.  The board moved to approve sale of these cables at $300 per roll, the buyer must coordinate with K1IW to pick up the cable at Hopkinton.  We prefer to have these go to Amateur Radio applications.  To that end, WA1NVC and W1DYJ offered to inquire for interested amateurs.

W1BRI and K1IW report that Quincy repairs are complete.  The repeaters are back to normal functioning at full power.

K1IW presented a plan for technical improvements to the MMRA system.  We took action on some of these items and noted others for the future.  A key aspect of this proposal is a new type of repeater controller under development by N1DDK.  Ultimately, the new controllers would be used at sites that host multiple repeaters and the other sites would get the SCom controllers that are capable of Internet control.  Thus all MMRA repeaters could be controlled via the internet.  Bob expects this project would take 3-years for development and deployment.  The board took these actions:
- Approved sale of the two spare 7K controllers.
- Approved an expenditure not to exceed $150 for a Raspberry Pi and Freedom Pop modem to provide Internet connectivity at the Quincy repeater site.
- Approved an expenditure not to exceed $500 for an SCom 7330 controller to be used at MRW.  (The controller currently at MRW would be used as an upgrade elsewhere in our network.)
- Took no action on a proposal to similarly upgrade Lowell to an SCom 7330 controller.
- Approved an expenditure not to exceed $450 to reimburse N1DDK for hardware needed to develop a prototype of his "PiPeater", with provision that the MMRA receives the prototype at completion of James' development effort.

We adjourned at 9 PM.
