October Business Meeting ~ Bob Evans, Clerk, N1BE

The MMRA board met on Oct 15 at 7 PM in the Maynard office of Stratus Technologies for a business meeting.  In attendance were K1KWP, K1IW, WA1NVC, N1BE, N1DDK, KB1LOY, KG1H, KB5JR and W1MPN.

Kevin, K1KWP presented a Treasurer Report highlighting MMRA finances since the start of the fiscal year on June 1.  Looking at projected expenses, we expect up to a 30% increase in electric bills (for Quincy and MRW).  Then we looked at income so far and projected for this fiscal year.  Next Kevin reviewed the costs of the Sligo antenna and shelter project, this project has been ongoing since the 2011 fiscal year.  Looking at the membership numbers, 98 of last year's members have not yet renewed, but there are 27 new members.

(Reminder, dues are now overdue.  MMRA memberships expire at the end of August.) 

Bob, K1IW discussed the need for a club Photo Archivist.  There are many MMRA photographs that need to be organized, in some online site.  Bob offered to solicit a volunteer by email.

The Westborough fire department has a used 50 foot Rohn tower available.  K1IW is inquiring about whether it is standing or on the ground.  Bob suggested that we could use this at a future repeater site.

Repeater Status report by K1IW:

The BEARS (Broadcast Engineers Amateur Radio Society) net equipment is at K1IW's shack.  Bob plans to install it at the Belmont repeater.  This would provide internet links to other BEARS repeater sites in CA, DC, FL and NY.

146.715 / 446.775 is off the air and being worked on by K1IW.  Bob is also changing terminations on cabling between controller and the radios for easier installation and removal for servicing.
There is some noise on 6M at MRW.

In response to an inquiry by a member, the board had a discussion about whether there is excessive messaging on the MMRA repeaters.  K1IW has already reduced some of the messaging.  Bob also suggested that we consider eliminating repeater announcements upon initial key-up.

The board moved that it would be useful to multiplex all the received voice audio at MRW, without messages, over the internet; also useful but not essential would be transmitting this audio.  The board approved this motion.  Boyd, KB5JR offered to bring a proposal back to the board of how to implement this function.

Sligo repeaters have several issues:

There are crunchies on 147.27.  We suspect an antenna mounting problem.  K1IW will contact the installer to investigate this.

927.700  is making a loud "buzz saw" noise.  There are also reports of intermod, choppy audio over IRLP - local audio is OK.  We think the buzz saw noise may be local to our repeater.  One suggestion was to try reducing the transmit problem to eliminate the buzz saw.  Another option is to link 927.700 to 449.925 for a day to further observe these problems.

James, N1DDK offered to install some hardware to allow "Tilt Down" of the 30-ft mast next to the MRW shelter.  James also offered to manage the installation of cooling for the MRW shelter - fans, duct work, etc.  The board approved an expenditure not to exceed $250 for these items.

Roger, WA1NVC discussed CFS hardline connectors.  One 900 MHz connector from MRW apparently has problems,  There is a concern that other hardline terminations may also have problems due to these new style connectors.  Discussion indicated this might not be a problem if the correct installation tool were used with the directions for installing this particular connector.  Roger offered to try replacing the problematic connector with an older style connector that will more firmly connect to the cable.

James, KB1LOY, the new trustee, visited the Hopkinton site and met with the contact person briefly there.  James and K1IW plan to together visit that site soon.

The meeting adjourned at 9PM.

The MMRA TECHNICAL CREW – ALWAYS READY
By Tom Turner, KB1OQA

One of the many groups within the organizational structure of the MMRA is the technical crew who constantly maintain and upgrade our repeaters located at various locations throughout Massachusetts.  These are the dedicated Hams with electronic expertise who are, for lack of a better term “on-call” when sites go down, antennas need to be replaced, new equipment needs to be installed and/or tested, and when on-going preventative maintenance is necessary to keep all systems working at peak efficiency.

A major project of the Technical Crew has been at Sligo Hill in Marlborough.  Now that antennas that had to be removed or relocated are now back on the refurbished Tower at their former heights, this group has been hard at work doing antenna reconnections and testing to make sure that our network provides the best-quality signal for its users.  

The services of the MMRA Network are called upon for such events as the Boston Marathon. The Head of the Charles Regatta, and many other Public Service venues for various organizations.  Without the work of this highly skilled group of Amateurs, our Organization would not be able to provide the high quality of service that it has become known for and their efforts should not be forgotten.  

(Editor: the MMRA can always use additional technical help.)
