Public Service
Bruce Pigott —  KC1US — Public Service Coordinator

Using the repeaters of the Minuteman Repeater Association for public service was discussed in the last newsletter.  Now how do you get involved?  

First, the season starts with supporting the world's oldest annual marathon — the Boston Marathon.  The MMRA home page will have a direct link to the sign up web site for hams shortly.  This year the race is on April 19, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord with a different group of Minutemen.  Assigning hundreds of operator slots requires that planning begins early.  There are many areas available for you to work at along the course, the start or the finish.  All levels of experience are needed.  Further details and contact information will be available on the Marathon Amateur Radio Communications web site.  MMRA members are heavily involved in the operator sign up process, race day communication equipment set up and volunteer logistics.

More opportunities will be mentioned in future months.

What is needed to participate at these events?  Simple equipment for the smaller events will be sufficient.  A two meter hand held with an extended antenna is the bare minimum.  This will allow you to reach more repeaters and operate on lower power.  The manufacturer supplied antenna is good for local coverage, however the larger activities will use additional repeaters that are more distant.  Your battery pack needs to last the entire event.  Unless the event is a short one, an extra pack will be needed.  This is good insurance in case one has not been charged recently or is advanced in age.  Become familiar with your radio and its instruction manual before the occasion.  There will be times you will have to check your operating mode, or program a new frequency, on site at your assignment.  A combination speaker and microphone is a good accessory due to the typical noisy environment of these activities.  

As you become more experienced, additional equipment will find its way into your bag.  Items such as dual band radios, small magnetic mobile antennas and maps to support more events become necessities.  See <http://www.mmra.org/pubserv/index.html> for a more extensive list of equipment applicable to the nature of the event.

President’s Corner ~ AMPLIFIERS!

Bob DeMattia — K1IW 

Who would ever have guessed that the main television transmitter for Channel 5 would be end up being final amplifiers for ham radio operators' 6m stations all over the globe?  Well, that's exactly what happened!  Club member K1RJZ, as chief engineer at WCVB saw an opportunity, offered it to us, and MMRA seized it!

The result, about 40 1KW solid state amps for 6m.

That was only the beginning.  On a Saturday in December, a pack of hams descended upon the TV station's transmitter building and took the transmitter apart:  Meter panels, amplifier modules, dummy loads, and various other parts were removed to be sold by the club.  At this point in time, about ten amplifier modules are left.

But the excitement is not over - thanks to W1BNC at Hearst Television, we've been in contact with a chief engineer at another Hearst station.  Another 25 amplifiers should be arriving shortly!  I think I can speak for the entire board in expressing our appreciate to Hearst, W1BNC and K1RJZ for making this all possible.  Additional thanks for to Dave Kaylor and Dave Beauvais (KB1QMX), also part of the channel 5 management team who were part of the project. Finally, I must thank the individuals that helped us decompose the transmitter.

November Membership Meeting
The PAVE PAWS Radar

Lt Col. Max Lantz, Commander, USAF 6th Space Warning Squadron presented a description of the U.S. Air Force's PAVE PAWS facility and its mission. He also fielded questions from the audience concerning PAVE PAWS and its relation to amateur radio.

The primary mission of the 6 SWS is to provide accurate and timely warning and space surveillance data to U.S. and allied decision makers for the safety and security of North America.  

The MMRA had the pleasure of having  Lt. Col. Max Lantz present the history of 6 SWS and discuss Ham Radio related issues.  The information was much too thick to relate here.

Did You Know…

One of the discussion items that came up during the meeting is the following:

No station may transmit with a transmitter power exceeding 50 W PEP on the UHF 70 cm band from an area specified in footnote US7 to §2.106 of the FCC Rules…

This area is within a 100 mile radius of Otis.  At least two active and long time MMRA members did not know this — your editor was one of them!

MMRA December Board of Directors Meeting
Bob Evans — N1BE — Clerk

The MMRA Board met at 7:30PM at the office of Conexant Systems in Waltham on Dec 16.  Present were KC1US, W1BRI, WA1NVC, W1DYJ, K1KWP, N1BE, K1RJZ, K1IW, N1BDA, W1MPN, W1JMC, and W3EVE.

K1KWP presented a report of the status of the MMRA treasury.  Surplus analog TV equipment contributions from WCVB (Channel 5) have been providing some unexpected income for the club.  Donations received this year matched the costs of maintenance and improvements to the MMRA system.  Memberships are down 21 from the end of last year.

K1IW discussed the price and cost of sales for surplus Larcan TV amps now being sold by the MMRA on eBay.  The "high-split" units are on sale for $350 each plus $30 shipping.  Shipping and the eBay fee costs about 10% of this amount.  These amps are also available directly from the MMRA for $320 plus $30 shipping.

At present none of the more desirable "low-split" units are on hand; the board is investigating a possibility of receiving a few more of these units.

K1RJZ reported that changing the frequency of the Boston 900MHz repeater provided a significant reduction in the QRM from part 15 devices.  The new frequency pair has been approved by NESMC.

WA1NVC suggested the MMRA get documentation of our agreements, to assure access to all repeater sites even if the persons providing liaison (the landlord) become unavailable to intervene.  W1JMC agreed to compile this documentation.  KC1US raised a secondary concern, to document the MMRA property at each repeater site; uniquely numbered asset tags were suggested as a way to provide this protection.

The Quincy 224.4 MHz repeater has been off the air for six months.  However, there have been no complaints about this repeater being down.  WA1NVC and W1BRI discussed the possibility of replacing the problematic Hamtronics exciter with some GE equipment.  W1BRI offered to pull this equipment the next time he is at the site and check it out.

W1BRI proposed we rework/prepare the new Sligo shelter currently being stored in Marlborough.  It needs to be cleaned up and wired for power before we can use it.  That work could be done this spring.

Topics for the January and March meetings were next discussed.

Newsletter articles are due to W1DYJ on Dec 30th.  There are only 10 members still receiving hardcopy newsletters.  For quality control, it was suggested that the one hardcopy sent to a board member should go to W1DYJ.  W3EVE agreed to print and mail out the next hardcopy newsletter.  In a related issue, the board approved printing 50 copies of an updated MMRA brochure for examinees at the monthly MMRA VE exams.

The board agreed to send a letter and plaque to WCVB thanking the station for their generous donations to the MMRA.

Don’t Forget!
Every Tuesday @ 8 PM
Technical, Informational and Other Stuff Net


The MMRA’s repeaters are linked Tuesday nights for the TIAOS Net.  Join us!  This is a good way to keep up with what is happening in the MMRA and ask your ham related questions.  We need another net control!

If you would like to try your hand at Net Control contact me at W1DYJ@mmra.org  – we have a script you can use to start with.  This is good practice for a number of ham related operations, from emergency preparedness to contesting.

Week 2	???		OPEN	
Week 3	W1DYJ		Larry Banks
