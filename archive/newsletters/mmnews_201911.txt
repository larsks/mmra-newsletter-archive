Amateur Radio Tower Safety: Is It Time for Change

Jim Idelson ~ K1IR 

Location: Marlborough Central Fire Station, 215 Maple Street (Rt. 85), Marlborough, MA
Enter through the side classroom door.
Talkin: 147.270

Come learn the three simple things every ham must do to dramatically reduce the deadly risks of tower work. Recent tragic events including the loss of our friend, Joe K1JGA, and the serious injuries sustained by Mike K1EEE drove a full investigation of amateur radio tower fatalities in the US over the past 20 years. The results of the 
research are disturbing, but they also show us exactly what we need to do to eliminate this problem in our community.
 
Jim Idelson K1IR is a lifelong ham with interests cutting across many aspects of the hobby. He is an active HF 
contester; he enjoys technical experimentation; he hosts a 2-meter DMR repeater at his QTH in Sudbury, MA. Professionally, Jim is founder and CEO of a company that provides consulting and analytics software for large companies using advanced collaboration tools. He also enjoys photography and playing the saxophone.

There will be a short Business Meeting before Jim’s presentation

At the October Business Meeting the MMRA Board of Directors directed that the following items be brought to the general membership for discussion and vote.  Note that per MMRA bylaws, the following improvements exceed $500 and require a membership vote.

Purchase one SCOM 7330 repeater controller, Raspberry Pi and accessories to upgrade the Mendon controller and make it internet accessible:  $600

Discussion:  The Mendon controller is needed to make the MMRA system 100% internet controlled.  All other existing repeaters have already been upgraded.  With the upgrade, control operator functions are easier and less intrusive. It also eases the process of debugging technical problems and performing  controller firmware upgrades.

(2) Purchase one SCOM 7330 repeater controller, Raspberry Pi and accessories, and internet linking equipment to put the 224.880  repeater online at Lahey Hospital in Burlington: $700

Discussion: The 224.880 repeater was removed from service when 223.94 was moved from Hopkinton to Marlborough.  It is now in storage.   146.715/446.775 were formerly located at Lahey Hospital in Burlington.  They were moved to North Reading in 2016.  This proposal is to locate 224.88 at the Burlington site (to which we still have access).

President’s Corner ~ David Hornbaker , N1DCH 

There have been two tower related deaths this year, eight in the last five years versus eight in the previous eleven years.  The frequency of tower incidents is increasing!  This month's meeting presentation "Amateur Radio Tower Safety: Is it time for a change?" will discuss this trend and present simple steps to reduce accidents.  If you have a tower or think you might have one someday, I urge you to attend Jim Idelson's, K1IR presentation on Wednesday 20 November at 7:30 PM at Marlborough Central Fire Station.

Reminder: All memberships expire in August.  If your membership expired in 2019 and you have not renewed, this will be the last newsletter you receive.  Please visit mmra.org and renew today.
Special thanks to Bob, K1IW and Bryan, W1BRI for their tireless work maintaining our repeater systems.

SKYWARN training – Mark your calendars!

MMRA will be sponsoring SKYWARN training on Wednesday, March 18 at 7:00 pm in the
Microsoft Office in Burlington, MA.  This will be an official training session presented by Ron Macedo, KD1CY.  Attendees will receive a spotter ID from the National Weather Service.

Public Service Activities  ~ Bruce Pigott, KC1US

On the home page of the MMRA web site is the phrase: "a non-profit organization providing communications infrastructure and volunteers for community and emergency events "  How has the Association done this in the past year?

Eight repeaters were set in special configurations in April for the Boston Marathon.  Support was provided for the ALS Association bicycle tours, Sharon triathlon, Brain Tumor Ride and for the Red Cross at the Head of the Charles Regatta.  The Eastern Massachusetts section Amateur Radio Emergency Service net is run on the first business Monday of each month.  Talk in coverage was provided for the Algonquin ARC flea market and the Northeast HamXposition.

Another group that is quite grateful, is the Heavy Hitters Traffic Net.  The combination of repeater locations and linking with Internet connection modes allows good coverage of the EMA section.  The net is run four times a week at 10 P.M.

Requests from organizers looking for communications assistance has been sent to those who have indicated an interest in Public Service in their membership data.  A number of MMRA hams have volunteered for these events.

From the Treasurer: Kevin Paetzold ~K1KWP

Notes on membership processing:
Processing membership and dues payments is a manual process that requires the secretary to process.  It may take a few days for memberships to be updated even when people use the web page and Paypal.

If the payment was sent to the PO box it likely will take at least a week because first I have to service the PO box and then the Secretary will still need to process the membership.

Because this is a manual process mistakes can be made and every year there is at least one.  If you believe our records are incorrect and/or that you paid and that it was not recorded. PLEASE let us know at contact@mmra.org.

18 September 2019 Membership Meeting 
Two Ideas for Skyhooks
Larry Banks, W1DYJ

After purchasing a second home on the coast of Maine, Larry had to build a new ham station from scratch. This talk described the concept, design, and implementation of an 18’ rotatable mast for a 6m Yagi, and a 34’ mast for HF dipoles.  It was not a “how to” talk, but “ideas” talk that may be yourself to others.  Here is a photo from the meeting and some of Larry’s slides.  The full talk is at:	<  https://www.qsl.net/w1dyj/Skyhooks.pdf  >.

Following are 19 screen grabs form Lrry's talk.

The Saga of North Reading
Larry, W1DYJ with lots of help from Bryan, W1BRI & Bruce, KC1US

The Problem
-----------
During the TIaOS net of 3 September (I was net control) we had a non-member, N1LHP (Doug, from Wilmington) break in to tell us we were interfering with his net on simplex channel 146.580.  This was the first, and only, report of this interference, but we took it seriously and deferred our net until Doug had finished his.  With no other reports, we brainstormed the potential causes and decided that there was either 1) a cross-band repeater that was inadvertently left active by whoever set it up or 2) a real issue with one of our repeaters.

We asked our membership for any reports of this abnormal transmission on 146.580, but none were received.  On 17 September during the TIaOS net I was able to investigate the issue.  I did hear a very faint signal on 146.58 that was coincident with our net.  Something was definitely wrong!  Again we asked the membership for additional reports of this signal and received none.

Before the net of 1 October I was finally able to faintly hear the 146.715 North Reading VHF repeater’s ID on 146.58.  We had finally located the offending repeater.  I am seven miles from the North reading site with “line-of-sight” antennas, so the interfering signal was indeed very faint.  During that evening’s net, K1LHP again broke into the net to tell us he had driven to the site and could hear the interfering spur quite strongly at the site, corroborating my findings.  We shut down the repeater after the net concluded.

Bryan, W1BRI, immediately developed a number of scenarios that could cause the spur.  Bruce, KC1US, visited the site on 4 October to run a number of tests to diagnose the problem. The conclusion was obvious: the repeater and duplexer had to be pulled and looked at on the bench.  Bruce and Bryan a few days later returned to retrieve the system.

The Fix
-------
Bryan, W1BRI, spent much time reworking the repeater.  From Bryan:

I completely re-wired it.  The original repeater had wires with Molex pins plugged into Molex connectors, I didn't like that so I soldered all wires with heat shrink and organized wires neatly. I also fixed power wires with Anderson Powerpoles for easy removal. I also cleaned up the MASTR II box with Windex, it was very dirty.

Then I re-tuned the exciter.  It had a missing slug on one of the coils so output power was about 100mW instead of 250mW.  Them I re-aligned the exciter.  Before doing any work I did see the 146.58 spur, after fixing the exciter the spur is gone.

On the PA the screws holding the RF power transistors to the heat sink were all loose; I had to remove a large heat sink off the PA to get at small nuts on the back of the screws to tighten them. All 3 power transistors had loose heat sink screws, I'm surprised in didn't burn out the transistors.

Finally, I complete re-tuned the duplexer per the TX RX tuning instructions.  Afterwards I set the PA TX output power to 60W.

On 23 October Bryan, W1BRI and Bruce, KC1US traveled back to North Reading to install the newly reworked repeater.   All now seems to be well.

Another Issue!
--------------
To make the situation even more interesting, shortly after Bryan, W1BRI, and Bruce, KC1US, removed the VHF repeater from the site, the UHF 446.775 repeater started acting up.  Fine when activated from the Hub’s link radio, when keyed up directly the repeater went into a sustained squeal until it timed out and transmitted its ID (my call sign, W1DYJ.)  North Reading VHF is a Fusion system, and we don’t understand what caused this squeal at this point.  However, reinstalling the VHF repeater, including power cycling the Fusion repeater solved the problem. If any of you hear this again, please send an email immediately to contact@mmra.org.
