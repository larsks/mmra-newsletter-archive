# MMRA Newsletters

The [Minuteman Repeater Association][mmra] (MMRA) maintains a linked network of
repeaters covering much of Eastern Massachusetts. The MMRA newsletter, The
Minuteman, is published five times a year, in September, November, January,
March, and May, to coincide with the regular MMRA membership meetings.

The newsletters are licensed under the [CC-BY-4.0] license.

I'd like to make the newsletter archive more useful. This repository will be by workspace for:

- Attempting to OCR all the old issues.
- Fixing encoding problems in the text format newsletters.
- Offer a full-text search interface to the newsletter content.
