# Re-imagining the MMRA newsletter

- [Newsletter archive](archive/)

  This is a copy of the MMRA newsletter archive. Mostly the content is identical do what you'll find on <https://www.mmra.org/newsltrs/index.html>, although I've made some attempt to fix character encoding issues in the text files.

- [Markdown newsletter](markdown/)

  This is my re-imagining of what the newsletter would be like if the primary format was a [markdown]-format text file.
