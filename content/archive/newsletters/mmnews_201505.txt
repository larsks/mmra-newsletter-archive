President’s Corner ~ Bob DeMattia, K1IW

MMRA Elections are being held at the next meeting on May 20th.  Once again, the board received no nominations for officers, so the entire board is running unopposed.  Assuming things go as they probably will, I'll be beginning my 12th term as MMRA president following the election.

When I was elected in 2004, we had about 185 members.  Today, that number is north of 250.  As a regional club, MMRA has some interesting challenges - the most prevalent of which is that local clubs tend to get priority over MMRA when events conflict.  Also as a regional club, MMRA needed to provide a reason for people to join beyond it just being a social activity.  In the past decade, I think we've done a good job of establishing our club as one whose primary purpose is public service.  Many public service oriented hams have joined because of this.

MMRA has also developed its repeater network extensively since 2004.  We have new locations as far south as Mendon and as far north as Lowell.  Through the generous contributions of time, effort, and money, MMRA now has repeaters at One Financial Center and the Prudential Tower in Boston.  We've added 900MHz and D-Star to our repertoire.

That being said, there have been some things that I would have liked to see improved that haven't.  In my first President's Corner, September 2004, I stated "I hope to see some increased participation from all of our members."  While membership activity is strong at our events, we still struggle to find members willing to serve as officers and/or in committee positions.

At the completion of my likely 12th term, I will not be running for reelection. By announcing this now, the club has a year to find someone willing and able to be the MMRA's next president.
I've enjoyed leading the club through the past decade - we've accomplished many things.  I hope that the next person will be able to continue this tradition.

April Business Meeting ~ Bob Evans, Clerk, N1BE

The MMRA Board met for a business meeting at 7PM on April 15th at Stratus Technologies in Maynard.  In attendance were K1KWP, K1IW, W1DYJ, N1BE, KA3RLZ, N1BDA, WA1NVC, N1DDK, W1BRI, K1BOS, KG1H, N1NVK and (by telephone) W1MPN.

Kevin, K1KWP, gave a Treasurer's Report with an overview of the MMRA finances and membership status.

Mike, W1MPN, proposed that the board develop a formal Budgeting Process for future MMRA fiscal years, where projects would be prioritized for the fiscal year.  The board was in favor and K1IW agreed to appoint a committee to develop a budget for the fiscal year that will begin in 2016.
Dave, KG1H, reviewed past and future public service events where the MMRA has involvement.  Dave also suggested more MMRA involvement at the Head of the Charles Regatta in October.
Bob, K1IW and Bryan, W1BRI discussed Repeater Status including 147.27 interference (possibly seasonal); 10 Meters will be off the air for the Marathon; 449.925 IRLP node disk and audio board problem; there is no tone output on 146.67; and a 145.09 MHz digipeater to be installed at MRE.

K1IW led a discussion of alternatives in moving the 449.575 repeater from Southboro to Hopkinton.  The board favored an expenditure of about $4200 to move the repeater and do some maintenance to the 223.94 repeater already at Hopkinton.  We also suggested finding another interested party doing work at the site to share costs of a tower climber.  The board will present a motion for approval of this expenditure at the May membership meeting.

K1IW reviewed a contract the City of Marlborough requested the MMRA to approve.  This contract formalizes the  terms under which the city provides space for the MRW repeater site.  The board agreed to signing this contract with a few minor changes to the original proposal by Marlborough.

We then discussed a proposal for affiliation with New England Amateur Radio Inc. (NEAR).  NEAR's purpose is to promote education and growth of amateur radio as a STEM activity (science, technology, engineering, and math), as a communications hobby, and as support for emergency preparedness and public service.  K1IW appointed N1DDK to chair a small committee to hone this proposal to something the board can approve.

Patrick, KC1AJT, is a club member and a student at PACE University.  He is working on a school project to  develop a network of two mesh-nodes - built from Linksys routers and 3' Yagi antennas.  In May, the project will be complete and he'd like to donate the equipment to the club.  The board approved accepting this equipment and we look forward to working with Patrick to decide how to deploy this equipment at some MMRA sites.
We discussed the agenda for May meeting, and K1IW recruited volunteers to find speakers/organize meetings for the following year.

K1IW discussed the MMRA at Boxboro.  Some members are getting together to sit at the same table at the Saturday night banquet.  There are a few more seats available to make two full tables.  Contact K1IW if you are interested in joining in.  We also are looking for help manning the MMRA booth.  (MMRA has the usual room and will be doing talk-in.)
 
The meeting adjourned at 8:50.

BOSTON MARATHON 2015 ~ Tom Turner, KB1OQA

Monday, April 20th was cold, showery, and in the high 30’s to low 40’s as I awoke at 0200 Hrs., had breakfast, and made preparations for the drive to Hopkinton, MA, the starting point for the 19th running of the Boston Marathon.  I had been assigned to work as a communications “Shadow” for one of the B.A.A. employees whose duty it was to oversee the so-called “Corrals,” where 30,000 runners from around the world form up to begin the 26.2 mile run to the Finish Line in Boston, MA.

Each year, approximately 300 Amateur Radio Operators volunteer their time, providing vital and needed communications services for this event.  Some work outside along the course itself in various roles, while others work inside at various Net Control points along the route.
On arrival in Hopkinton, I was directed to the State Park, where I parked my car, and was taken by shuttle bus to the Town Common.  Our START Team of approximately 34 Hams were issued the necessary credentials for the areas we would be working in, such as the Athletes Village, Town Common, and the Starting  Line area.  Our Team was also briefed on the start times of the various segments of the Marathon, along with relevant updates, such as assignment changes, weather conditions,  etc.

There was a high Police presence comprised of Federal, Local, and State Law enforcement agencies and security was extremely tight, as was the case in 2014.  Security sweeps took place periodically   to insure the safety of everyone involved; BAA  personnel, Runners, and volunteers alike.

The START Team operated on several simplex frequencies, supplemented by a repeater frequency to insure complete and seamless communications during this event.

Shortly before 10 AM, the race began. Since everyone can’t be at the Starting Line at the same time, releases are staggered.  The runners are released in four “waves,” due to their large numbers, and it’s quite a sight to see.

By 11:30 AM, the last of the runners had crossed the Starting Line and were on their way to Boston.  There were no emergencies in Hopkinton involving those running or working the event.  The rain began to pour as I made my way back to the Bus Stop to pick up my car for the ride home.

For new Hams interested in Public Service venues, the Boston Marathon provides a great learning opportunity.  Many of us have worked this event for several years, gaining much knowledge about radio usage, and making new friends at the same time.  I would recommend it to all.
