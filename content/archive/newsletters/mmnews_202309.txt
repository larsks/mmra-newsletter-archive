The Minuteman Repeater Association is a non-profit organization providing
communications infrastructure and volunteers for community and emergency events.
----------
Membership Meeting: Wednesday, 20 September 2023  ~7:30—9:30 pm

The National traffic system (NTS), nets in the area, and the basics of sending a radiogram.
Marcia Forde, KW1U & Joe Weisse, W1HAI

This is a Hybrid meeting: New England SciTech + ZOOM
Members: log into your account on MMRA.ORG to obtain the ZOOM info.
Non-members: send an email to contact@mmra to request the ZOOM info.

Learn the skills of accurate and efficient message relay using the radiogram format, 
including the ICS-213 forms. Learn how traffic nets, such as the Heavy Hitters Traffic Net (HHTN: which is hosted on our MMRA repeater network) can help you learn and practice those skills that emergency communications agencies require. Be prepared to help if called upon! 

Marcia Forde KW1U began 40 plus years of message handling in 1981 and over the ensuing years has held various positions such as Official Relay Station, Net Control Station, Net Manager, Section Traffic Manager (STM) and others.  In addition to her current position as STM for three New England sections she also has been serving on the NTS subcommittee of ARRL's EC&FS committee, charged with improving and revitalizing NTS with added emphasis on emergency communications. 

Joe Weiss, W1HAI, has been a ham since 1966 and has been affiliated with the MMRA since the mid-70’s.  He was HHTN net manager from July 2015 to August 2023.  He is still involved with the net and others including ARES Skywarn and Natick nets.

Repeater Status Report – from Bob DeMattia, K1IW
	Prudential Antenna – The new Boston-Prudential Antenna was installed on April 25th.  The repeater can be keyed all the way down the Mass Pike to the Route 495 exit. Bob has linked this repeater to Hub 1. Please refer to the May MMRA Newsletter, (page 10) for his complete report with photos. 
	North Reading – The site cleanup is still scheduled for June 10th. However, an additional date will be scheduled to upgrade the 2m repeater when the new Kenwood is received.  
	10 Meter Weston Receiver: - The intermittent functioning still evident. See notation on 2m.
	6 Meters: No further issues reported at tonight’s membership meeting.
	2 Meter Weston Repeater – Bob and Dave visited this site regarding the 10m and 2m Repeater issue. The SWR issue that was brought up during the February Monthly Business Meeting is possibly due to water getting into the coax, or possibly hardline damage. 
	All other MMRA Repeater systems normal – No other malfunctions reported.

Presentation: An Introduction to POTA – Dave Hornbaker – N1DCH

POTA is Parks On The Air – founded in September, 2010 – as a fun and challenging way to enjoy Ham Radio.  The two different activities are Hunting and Activating.

Hunters register on the POTA website at https://parkesontheair.com and https://pota.app . Please read and follow the rules. Each Federal and State Park are assigned specific park numbers. For example, the Appalachian Trail is 
K-4556-MA in Massachusetts. In Maine it is K4556-ME

Activating a park requires planning by verifying park hours, park boundaries and ensuring your batteries are charged up, packing a “go bag” with equipment to operate a station, sunscreen, bug repellant and other essentials to operate safely without interfering with other park visitors. Operate safely and CLEAN UP after you are finished. Then prepare your log(s) for submission.

Software: Dave provided a chart listing the programs to use. Most are free. For logging Dave uses N3FJP at https://www.n3fjp.com for $34.99. He also uses N3FJP contest program for contesting.  For operating FT8 or FT4 use WSJT. One very important software piece to identify your Grid Square is called “Ham Square” for you phone for free. 
Another program is WWFF – World Wide Flora & Fauna – https://wwff.co  https://wwff-kff.org . On getting started with WWFF do the Registration form and read the rules for Global and the USA

[There are a number of Dave's slides in the PDF version of the newsletter.]

Treasurer’s Report ~ Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP 

It was good to see so many members at the expo in Marlborough.

The MMRA receives a significant amount of donations each year.  On behalf of the club I would like to acknowledge and thank people below who donated since my list in the May newsletter:  KC1CLA, N1CVO, N1DCH, and KC1HPZ.

My records indicate that at this point about 55% of the members from last year have renewed for this year.  If your membership expires in 2023 then it expired on August 31.  If your records are different than the club’s records, for example you renewed but do not see it indicated in your record please let us know at contact@mmra.org.

Repeater Report ~ North Reading Cleanup ~ 10 June 2023

----------

19 June 2023  Business/Membership Meeting ~ Minutes

Called to order @ 7:40 PM

The first item on tonight’s agenda is Part Two – a Live demonstration - of the AREDN technology. The Part One Presentation was presented back at our March monthly meeting by Orv Beech from the West Coast, Michael Ford from the East Coast and Jim Garner who was slated to perform a live demonstration, but due to a pending snowstorm the MMRA decided to change the live meeting to a Zoom only meeting for travel safety concerns.

Presentation: 

AREDN (Part Two) – Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network – by Michael Ford, WZ0C and Jim Gardner, KC1BHD  
To review briefly Michael showed us an AR300M for around $35 on Amazon as the hardware needed to get on AREDN. The software is the heart of the AREDN network Specs on compatible hardware and the software needed to download are found at https://www.arednmesh.org/ and extensive documentation is located at https://docs.arednmesh.org/en/latest/ on getting started. If you have an old Router check the AREDN website to verify it is compatible with their network. Like Ham Radio you can spend very little to get started or you can go to extensive equipment and expense. 

Simply stated AREDN uses 2.4 Gigs and 5.6 Gigs. However, 2.3 and 5.7 Gigs are used too along with discretely using channels within those frequencies to avoid interference. For example, channel -2 (minus two) is used because it has less noise on it from interference. Data, such as images, voice and files can be sent through the AREDN system. When you register on AREDN, your callsign is submitted as the first element of your user identity as you must be a licensed Ham Radio Operator to use the system. Hospitals and other users are recipients of the data sent on AREDN and can submit data as part of the emergency feature of AREDN. 

During tonight's live demonstration Jim showed us how to get onto the mesh network and many of us logged in with our mobile phones to actually view and participate. During this live demonstration both Jim and Michael describe how the network works once you are set up as a remote node on the AREDN MESH network. As a practice test Jim sent out a message and one of us sent a reply in response. Seeing is believing far beyond any words that I can express in these minutes. The New England Region is just beginning to use this MESH network. In Maine the network is developing on part of the east coast. In New Hampshire Manchester is using AREDN to connect their hospitals. In Massachusetts mesh is starting to be deployed on Cape Cod. When asked what they envision from the MMRA, both Michael and Jim expressed that we might be a part of the development of AREDN in Eastern Massachusetts and the New England Region. While no specifics were discussed at this meeting, the overall  sentiment seemed to be positive as some may decide to get the portable mobile router mentioned earlier. 

The Presentation portion of this meeting ended at 8:53 PM

Repeater Status Report – from Bob DeMattia – K1IW –  

 + Brookline – Receiver has been completely removed.

 + Prudential Antenna – 
	DCI Filter can be reused on new repeater at Pru.
	2M antennas can serve as a replacement for Weston, if required, is being stored there.
	This also leaves us with a 2nd spare 7330 controller, two commercial quality link antennas and a variable voltage power supply.
	Quantar for Prudential is being donated by NN1C, which Bob will be picking up tonight at NE Sci-Tech

Bob asked with the Prudential 2M working well, is there really a need to have both Quincy and Prudential full time linked? Both have coverage that is nearly identical to Quincy and Quincy has relatively a lot of local traffic. For the time being, “leave it be.”

 + North Reading – The site cleanup has been completed. Now awaiting new repeater. Kenwood NXR710i’s have been “picked” at the warehouse and should arrive “any day” now. 

 + All other MMRA Repeater systems normal – No other malfunctions reported.

HamXposition –  August 25-27
 + MMRA ad in Program – Color Centerfold is $350 – Dave, N1DCH, made a motion to do the color centerfold spot, seconded by Bob, N1BE with the motion passed.
 + Door Prize – A motion was made by Larry, W1DYJ, to not exceed $400, seconded by Kevin, K1KWP and passed unanimously. Kevin will be doing the prize drawing on Sunday at noon. 
 + Talk-In-Station – Dave has Mast, Kevin will bring Radio with power supply. The YCCC has a station, W1A, too. Bob was suggesting that the MMRA might be able to help out if the YCCC cannot find enough volunteers. 
 + Monitor – We may need a monitor if Kevin determines it is not working.
 + Fox Hunt – as there are more than just the MMRA FoxBox, coordination will be needed.

Get connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH

What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?  Try announcing yourself!  Just say your call sign followed by "listening".   If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the repeater frequency. For example, "N1DCH listening" or maybe "N1DCH listening on 925", you may very well get a response.  Try to connect by announcing yourself several times.

Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and 146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (449.575) and Quincy (146.67.)  Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the repeaters are linked.

You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself.  See the information you received when you became a 
member, or check the User Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.

Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is linked at various times, check out https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.
