MMRA Repeater Linking, Operation, and Control Presentation
Kevin Paetzold K1KWP
Location: ZOOM — Members: login to the MMRA Webpage for the link
----------

Could you make more effective use the of the linked systems capabilities? Would you like to understand what is happening when your transmission gets into the repeater system and how it gets to the other repeaters.

This presentation will include and disclose the various control codes available to members on the “members code sheet” which is available when members log into the mmra.org website members page.

Historically, disclosure of these control codes was considered one of the benefits of MMRA membership and this information was not made available to non-members. During this presentation the control codes will be openly disclosed and demonstrated. For that reason this zoom meeting is for members only and unlike other meetings will not be open to amateurs who are not members.

There will NOT be a recording of this meeting so to see this presentation you will need to attend the meeting.

Discussed will be how the various repeaters actually link up and the various different linked and unlinked modes. Knowledge of how the system works and ability to change things also allows people to potentially help diagnose any network/repeater issues that come up. This knowledge can be useful if you are a net control for a net on the repeater system including public service
activities.

Some example slides are shown on the next page.


Kevin Paetzold (K1KWP) has been a member of the MMRA since 1998 and has been an elected officer of the MMRA since 2000. Kevin was employed as an engineer and engineering manager in the Massachusetts based computer industry for over 40 years. Ham radio interests include APRS, packet, satellite, and the
MMRA.

The next page shows three of the slides that Kevin will use during the presentation:
   Slide 1 - Double Configuration.  Two repeaters on one controller.
   Slide 2 - Availavble links from the two hubs
   SLide 3 - Split site example

President’s Corner ~ David Hornbaker, N1DCH

Summer has arrived! This summer, MMRA will hold a rare JULY meeting. Kevin, K1KWP will present MMRA Repeater Linking, Operation, and Control. This will be a members only meeting. Please do not share the Zoom meeting information with non-members.

Good news! The August Business meeting and the September membership meeting will be Hybrid. We will be meeting at New England Sci-Tech and via Zoom. The August Business meeting will give us a chance to test out hybrid meetings before we have a larger meeting with a presentation. I expect that all future meetings will be hybrid. This format will allow MMRA to serve our widespread membership better.

Membership renewal! All MMRA memberships expire in August. Please check your profile and if your membership expires this year, please renew.

Please visit our table at HamXposition September 9-11 in Marlborough. Check out HamXposition's web site for more information https://www.hamxposition.org/

Join us Tuesday nights at 8:00 PM for our weekly Technical Information and Other Stuff (TIaOS) net. There will be a lively discussion on all sorts of HAM issues, including equipment, antennas, software, repeaters, and other stuff. The main purpose is to test our ability to link up the repeaters in case of an emergency, or to support some event like a marathon. You can also join via EchoLink if your radio is a little under the weather. See below
for more information.

You can find out more information about how and when the repeaters are linked on the website https://www.mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html).

Please remember to keep your profile up to date, especially if your email changes. Note that if your callsign changes, send email to contact@mmra.org and we will update your callsign in the database.
