<p>Andy Stewart (KB1OIQ) will give a talk about a popular software
collection called “Andy’s Ham Radio Linux” (AHRL). In its latest
version, AHRL has been tested on several flavors of Debian, Ubuntu, and
Raspberry Pi OS. AHRL is installed on top of whatever Linux you’re
already running. It provides over 80 ham radio programs which are all
Free Software, Open Source Software, or equivalently licensed. Andy will
discuss the changes to the most recent version, and will also give a
high level overview of the available programs.</p>
<p>Andy has been licensed since 2007, and now holds an Amateur Extra
license. Andy is a retired computer engineer, having retired in August
2024.</p>

PM. Please see the Elmer section below for Zoom meeting information</p>
<p>Join us for the January 15, 2025, membership meeting at Marlborough
Central Fire Station. Andy Stewart ~ KB1OIQ will be discussing: “Andy’s
Ham Radio Linux (AHRL)”. AHRL is a collection of amateur radio Linux
tools. If you cannot make it to Marlborough, this is a hybrid meeting,
and the Zoom meeting information is available on the website

<h2 id="mmra-elmering-kevin-paetzold-k1kwp">MMRA Elmer(ing) ~ Kevin
Paetzold, K1KWP</h2>
<p>In the November newsletter it was announced that the MMRA will be
hosting an Elmering/Mentoring session. The intention is to give new or
prospective hams a place to get questions answered, how to use their ham
radio license, getting on the air, getting their license, info about
local ham resources, and programming their radio. This is purposely
being held on zoom so that unlicensed people can participate as well as
the multimedia aspect of zoom vs. just a repeater contact.</p>
<div class="right">
<p><img src="assets/elmering.png"
alt="Image showing participants in the Zoom meeting." /></p>
</div>
<p>I have heard members state that they do not think they are qualified
to be an Elmer. That is completely wrong. If you have a license and have
been on the air then you are certainly able to mentor other hams. The
experience of new hams is just as important as people who have been
licensed for decades. For example I bought most of my radios &gt;20
years ago and I am not the best person to give advice on new
equipment.</p>
<p>The first official session was held on Dec 11. There were 14
attendees and the session lasted a good 90 minutes. I want to thank all
those who have supported this effort and made themselves available to
staff the sessions.</p>
<p>I encourage all members to seriously consider supporting and
attending the Elmer Forum. A website with a “flyer” giving info on this
is available at <a href="https://mmra.org/elmerforum/elmerforum.pdf"
class="uri">https://mmra.org/elmerforum/elmerforum.pdf</a>. The plan is
the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 7:30 PM. The next one is Wednesday
Jan 8 at 730PM which may happen before this newsletter issue was
published. Additional sessions are February 12, March 12, and April 9.

<h2 id="treasurers-report-kevin-paetzold-k1kwp">Treasurer’s Report ~
Kevin Paetzold, K1KWP</h2>
<p>The MMRA receives donations each year. On behalf of the club I would
like to acknowledge and thank the following members who have donated
since my list in the November newsletter: KC1POR and KC1VNA.</p>
<p>So far 236 members have either renewed or recently joined since
September 1, 2024 when the new membership year (2024-2025) started. This
is the same number as the 2023-2024 year. However as of this writing 60
members who entered grace period on September 1 have not yet renewed and
will have expired on January 1. This also means that 60 members are new
either paid or free new hams.</p>
<p>We have three repeaters (Quincy, Belmont, Billerica) which we will
need to relocate before very long. We will likely have significant costs
associated with each these repeater re-locations if/when they actually
happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quincy will likely require new shelter, antennas?, quantum unit of
commercial antenna climber</li>
<li>Belmont likely requires antenna(s), quantum unit of commercial
antenna climber</li>
<li>Billerica quantum unit of commercial antenna climber</li>
</ul>
<p>I previously forecast that I could easily see this being $10000 of
spending. Because the membership approved $3000 spending for Billerica
at the November meeting I can now see this being $13000 in spending for
the three sites. It may not all happen in the same year but we need to
prepare for this.</p>
<p>In addition as of this writing the 146.82 repeater is essentially off
the air with a new problem which is not yet completely diagnosed. If
this requires antenna system repair that is likely another quantum unit
of commercial antenna climber ($3000).</p>

Billerica Moving Expenses</h3>
<p>Before a motion was made, the new location is near the water tower
with 3 coax cables not in use that are available for the MMRA to use.
The site appears clean from the outside. There are 3 iterations of
repeaters along with cabinets, desks and other things that we will need
a work party to gather up for disposal. A 6m repeater was taken down at
that location. Also, according to Roger, this site has a generator and
electricity is provided without cost to the MMRA. Bob adds that we have
used this same climber in the past and must have 2 months’ lead time
before scheduling his part.</p>
<p>The expense breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climber $2,100</li>
<li>Second Antenna $ 600</li>
<li>U-Haul &amp; Misc Parts $ 300</li>
</ul>
<p>Dave made a motion to approve up to a $3,000 to move the Billerica
Repeater to this new site. Seconded by Larry and the motion passed with
a unanimous vote.</p>

<p>The official start for these monthly coaching sessions starts on

<p>We had an unofficial Elmer Forum start on November13th with 2 new
Hams participating along with 4-5 of us acting as Elmers. For this
practice Elmer Forum session, many questions were asked and answered. We
expect these coaching sessions will grow with more participants.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to learn about the most suitable equipment to
buy without breaking your budget, how to program your radios, where and
when you can get on the air and so much more.</p>

id="presentation-by-dave-hornbaker-n1dch---programming-your-radio-with-chirp">Presentation
by Dave Hornbaker: N1DCH - “Programming Your Radio with CHIRP”</h3>
<p>David’s interest in radio began as a youngster when he hung around
his Uncle Myron Hornbaker’s shack ~ W0GFU (SK) in Fowler, Kansas. In
1975 he earned a First-Class Radiotelephone Operator License (now
General Radiotelephone Operator License). At a local telephone company
David installed IMTS Telephones in automobiles. Later he worked for
Wichita, KS television station ~ KAKE-TV as a master control operator.
David has worked in the Computer Industry for over 40 years. He owns and
is President of DCH Consulting Services, an Information Technology
Company, has a Master of Science, Information Technology Degree from the
University of Massachusetts and is President of the MMRA.</p>
<p>CHIRP is free, open-source software for programming many radios from
various manufacturers. This software is available on Windows, MacOS and
Linux. There are two versions of CHIRP: Next and Legacy. Next is the
newest version and Legacy is the older version. To download CHIRP go to
<a href="https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/"
class="uri">https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/</a>.</p>
<p>Dave described the installation process on the three operating
systems. Once installed and the unique cable that connects to a specific
radio is in place, the first task is download the contents of what is on
the radio to a computer file. The file received is either a clone file
or a live file. The difference between these two types of files is the
clone file is a static copy of the contents of the radio that can be
edited and uploaded later back to the radio versus a live clone file
that can be edited on the fly instantaneously to the radio. One other
thing to note on the cable that connects from the computer to the radio
is using a high-quality cable that has the 2303 or fai chipset for data
transfers.</p>

<h3 id="repeater-status-report-bob-demattia-k1iw-1">Repeater Status
Report: Bob DeMattia, K1IW</h3>
<ul>
<li>Belmont: 145.43: Ed, KC1CLA, has has contacted them during the last
month and they have not responded. The plan is to move 145.43 to
Burlington.</li>
<li>Billerica 147.12: Bob has been in contact with the Town Manager,
currently awaiting an approval.
<ul>
<li>If Billerica site becomes available, move 147.12 and 224.88 to the
new Billerica site.</li>
<li>If the Billerica site is not available, the repeater will move
147.12 to Burlington.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Boston 146.82: Power output has dropped – K1BOS is investigating. He
has tightened all connections with no improvement. He will return with a
Wattmeter.</li>
<li>Boston 927.0625: The new Boston 900 Repeater has been built by
WA1NVC. It is in burn-in testing.</li>
<li>Burlington 224.88: The Burlington (link radio needs repair. (TX no
power) Bob will fix it once we figure out the Billerica situation.</li>
<li>Lowell 442.250: The Lowell link radio needs repair (TX low power).
The link still works through North Reading, so there is no immediate
need to make the trip to repair it.</li>
<li>Marlborough 449.925: Hub1 link radio needs repair (TX low power and
TX audio needs PL filter). The link radio is in Bob’s garage for
repairs.</li>
<li>Marlborough 927.700: WA1NVC discussing upgrade.</li>
<li>Marlborough West — While many may not have noticed, the anemometer
at Marlborough West is fixed.</li>
<li>Quincy 146.67: With no word – letter or phone call – from the
Mayor’s Office - the current plan looks likely to move 146.67 to
Marlborough East.</li>
<li>All other Repeaters: Functioning normally.</li>

<li>Should members be able to determine the membership status of another

</ul>
<p>The discussion varied. Roger suggested we keep it simple to name and
callsign. Membership status ranged from member to non-member all the way
from member to membership in the grace period (September 1st to December
31st) to recently expired membership from January 1st onward to one year
or longer. No decision on this subject was made at tonight’s meeting
other than investigating it further before any formal motion is
made.</p>
<h3 id="mmra-elmer-forum-kevin-k1kwp">MMRA Elmer Forum: Kevin,
K1KWP</h3>
<p>These Elmering sessions are on Zoom to both licensed and unlicensed
Hams on the 2nd Wednesday of each month. November 13, 2024, was our
initial informal Elmer Meeting Event, which was attended by a few
people. On December 11, 2024, our first formal Elmer Session, was
attended by 14 people, with one who was not licensed yet. We had several
questions asked from recent new Hams. Many questions about licensing and
upgrading, several questions on VHF/UHF and even more HF related
questions.</p>
<p>One comment Kevin saw in the zoom chat section said, “I have learned
more about ham radio from the MMRA than from the ARRL.” We had some
attendees that found round zero (from November) interesting enough that
they came to this December forum and plan to come to the next in
January.</p>

<h3>Boston 900 MHz Quantar</h3>
<p>Here (included photo) is the Boston 900 MHz Quantar. It has been
completely aligned, programmed, tested on the test pair, and will be
burned in for a week or two. You will notice a red circle. I have added
a V.24 interface board and cover plate with cutouts for the jacks. This
will allow us to do P25 networking, if we want to, at some time in the
future.</p>

class="uri">https://www.mmra.org/MMRACOPolicy-March2019.pdf</a></p>
<p>The Minuteman Repeater Association (MMRA) is dedicated to Amateur
Radio and public service. The MMRA maintains a large system of repeaters
in Eastern Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The MMRA meets each month from September to June. Meeting times,
locations, and talk-in frequency vary and are announced in this
newsletter and on weekly nets. Meetings are open to all interested
parties. Guest speakers and programs of general interest occur in
September, November, January, March, and May. The intervening meetings
are also open to all members and are for general business.</p>
<p>The Minuteman newsletter is emailed one week before each general
interest meeting. Members are encouraged to submit articles: send to the
editor at newsletter@mmra.org. The deadline for articles is the last
Friday of the month preceding the meeting.</p>
<p>Each Tuesday evening at 8pm the MMRA links most of the repeaters for
an open net. The topic is “Technical Information and Other Stuff”. Join
us!</p>
<p>Membership in the MMRA is open to all radio amateurs. Annual dues are
$25 per individual or $35 per family. See our website for details.</p>
<p>Contact information is listed on the top of the last page of this
newsletter. No part of this newsletter can be copied or posted elsewhere
without prior approval from the club.</p>
<h2 id="mmra-qrm-policy">MMRA QRM Policy</h2>
<p>MMRA members and all other operators are strongly encouraged to
report repeater activity that does not abide by Part 97 rules or
accepted amateur radio practice to the board of directors at <a
href="mailto:contact@mmra.org" class="email">contact@mmra.org</a> or via
other means.</p>
<p>The most effective way (and probably the only effective way) to deal
with an individual causing QRM is to NOT engage with that individual on
the air. Please include the time and date of any incident.</p>

<h2
id="get-connected-on-the-mmra-repeater-system-dave-hornbaker-n1dch">Get
connected on the MMRA Repeater System ~ Dave Hornbaker N1DCH</h2>
<p>What is the best way to get connected on the MMRA repeater system?
Try announcing yourself! Just say your call sign followed by
“listening”. If you want, you can include the last 3 digits of the
repeater frequency. For example, “N1DCH listening” or maybe “N1DCH
listening on 925”, you may very well get a response. Try to connect by
announcing yourself several times.</p>
<p>Most of the time, Marlborough Hub1 (449.495) is linked to the
following repeaters, Boston (146.820), North Reading (446.775 and
146.715), Mendon (146.610), Lowell (442.250), Hopkinton (448.225) and
Quincy (146.67.) Remember that when the repeaters are linked, you need
to wait two or three seconds after you key up and before you speak. This
is especially important on the TIaOS net on Tuesday when most of the
repeaters are linked.</p>
<p>You can also link (and delink) the repeaters yourself. See the
information you received when you became a member, or check the User
Control Codes once you log into the MMRA web.</p>
<p>Try one of the non-linked repeaters too. There are Hams monitoring
them as well. For more information on the repeater network and how it is
linked at various times, check out
https://mmra.org/repeaters/repeater_linking.html.</p>
